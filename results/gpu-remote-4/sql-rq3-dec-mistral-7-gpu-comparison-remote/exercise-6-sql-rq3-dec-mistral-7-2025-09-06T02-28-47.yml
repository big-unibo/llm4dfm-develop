  \ I have one more question. How would you handle a scenario where a measure is a\
  \ calculated field, not a direct attribute of a table?\n\nFor example, let's say\
  \ we have a table called `SALES` with the following columns: `sale_id`, `product_id`,\
  \ `quantity`, `price`, `discount`, `date`. We want to calculate the `total_revenue`\
  \ as `quantity * price * (1 - discount)`. How would you represent this in the DFM\
  \ schema?\n\nIn this case, the `total_revenue` is not a direct attribute of the\
  \ `SALES` table, but rather a calculated field based on the other attributes.\n\n\
  Here's the YAML representation of the `SALES` table:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n\
  \  - name: total_revenue\ndependencies:\n  - from: SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.quantity\n\
  \  - from: SALES.price\n    to: SALES.price\n  - from: SALES.discount\n    to: SALES.discount\n\
  \nIn this case, the `total_revenue` measure is not directly connected to any table\
  \ attribute. How would you represent this in the DFM schema?\n\nTo handle a scenario\
  \ where a measure is a calculated field, not a direct attribute of a table, you\
  \ can add an empty item in the \"measures\" section of the DFM schema, and then\
  \ define the calculation in the \"dependencies\" section.\n\nHere's the YAML representation\
  \ of the `SALES` table with the calculated measure:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n\
  \  - name: total_revenue\ndependencies:\n  - from: SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.quantity\n\
  \  - from: SALES.price\n    to: SALES.price\n  - from: SALES.discount\n    to: SALES.discount\n\
  \  - from: SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.price\n    role: quantity\n  - from: SALES.price\n\
  \    to: SALES.discount\n    role: price\n  - from: SALES.quantity, SALES.price,\
  \ SALES.discount\n    to: total_revenue\n    role: calculate\n\nIn this example,\
  \ the calculated measure `total_revenue` is represented as an empty item in the\
  \ \"measures\" section. The calculation is defined in the \"dependencies\" section,\
  \ with the roles \"quantity\", \"price\", and \"calculate\" indicating the attributes\
  \ involved in the calculation and the fact that it is a calculated measure, respectively.\
  \ I see. Thank you for the explanation. One more question: How would you handle\
  \ a scenario where a measure is a derived measure, i.e., a measure that is calculated\
  \ based on other measures?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a table called `PRODUCTS`\
  \ with the following columns: `product_id`, `product_name`, `category_id`, `average_rating`,\
  \ `num_reviews`. We want to calculate the `average_rating_per_category` as the average\
  \ of the `average_rating` for each product in a given category. How would you represent\
  \ this in the DFM schema?\n\nIn this case, the `average_rating_per_category` is\
  \ a derived measure based on the `average_rating` measure.\n\nHere's the YAML representation\
  \ of the `PRODUCTS` table:\n\nfact:\n  name: PRODUCTS\nmeasures:\n  - name: average_rating\n\
  \  - name: num_reviews\ndependencies:\n  - from: PRODUCTS.product_id\n    to: PRODUCTS.product_id\n\
  \  - from: PRODUCTS.product_name\n    to: PRODUCTS.product_name\n  - from: PRODUCTS.category_id\n\
  \    to: PRODUCTS.category_id\n  - from: PRODUCTS.average_rating\n    to: PRODUCTS.num_reviews\n\
  \nIn this case, the `average_rating_per_category` is not a direct attribute of the\
  \ `PRODUCTS` table, but rather a derived measure based on the `average_rating` measure.\
  \ How would you represent this in the DFM schema?\n\nTo handle a scenario where\
  \ a measure is a derived measure, you can add another empty item in the \"measures\"\
  \ section of the DFM schema, and then define the calculation in the \"dependencies\"\
  \ section.\n\nHere's the YAML representation of the `PRODUCTS` table with the derived\
  \ measure:\n\nfact:\n  name: PRODUCTS\nmeasures:\n  - name: average_rating\n  -\
  \ name: num_reviews\n  - name: average_rating_per_category\ndependencies:\n  - from:\
  \ PRODUCTS.product_id\n    to: PRODUCTS.product_id\n  - from: PRODUCTS.product_name\n\
  \    to: PRODUCTS.product_name\n  - from: PRODUCTS.category_id\n    to: PRODUCTS.category_id\n\
  \  - from: PRODUCTS.average_rating\n    to: PRODUCTS.num_reviews\n  - from: PRODUCTS.average_rating\n\
  \    to: average_rating_per_category\n    role: average\n  - from: PRODUCTS.category_id\n\
  \    to: average_rating_per_category\n    role: category\n\nIn this example, the\
  \ derived measure `average_rating_per_category` is represented as an empty item\
  \ in the \"measures\" section. The calculation is defined in the \"dependencies\"\
  \ section, with the roles \"average\" and \"category\" indicating that it is a derived\
  \ measure based on the `average_rating` measure and the category attribute, respectively.\
  \ I see. Thank you for the explanation. One more question: How would you handle\
  \ a scenario where a measure is a time-based measure, i.e., a measure that is calculated\
  \ based on the time dimension?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a table called\
  \ `SALES` with the following columns: `sale_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`,\
  \ `discount`, `date`. We want to calculate the `monthly_revenue` as the sum of the\
  \ `total_revenue` for each sale in a given month. How would you represent this in\
  \ the DFM schema?\n\nIn this case, the `monthly_revenue` is a time-based measure\
  \ based on the `date` attribute.\n\nHere's the YAML representation of the `SALES`\
  \ table:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n  - name: total_revenue\ndependencies:\n\
  \  - from: SALES.sale_id\n    to: SALES.sale_id\n  - from: SALES.product_id\n  \
  \  to: SALES.product_id\n  - from: SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.quantity\n  - from:\
  \ SALES.price\n    to: SALES.price\n  - from: SALES.discount\n    to: SALES.discount\n\
  \  - from: SALES.date\n    to: SALES.date\n\nIn this case, the `monthly_revenue`\
  \ is not a direct attribute of the `SALES` table, but rather a time-based measure\
  \ based on the `date` attribute. How would you represent this in the DFM schema?\n\
  \nTo handle a scenario where a measure is a time-based measure, you can add another\
  \ empty item in the \"measures\" section of the DFM schema, and then define the\
  \ calculation in the \"dependencies\" section. You can also include the time dimension\
  \ in the dependencies to specify the granularity of the measure.\n\nHere's the YAML\
  \ representation of the `SALES` table with the time-based measure:\n\nfact:\n  name:\
  \ SALES\nmeasures:\n  - name: total_revenue\n  - name: monthly_revenue\ndependencies:\n\
  \  - from: SALES.sale_id\n    to: SALES.sale_id\n  - from: SALES.product_id\n  \
  \  to: SALES.product_id\n  - from: SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.quantity\n  - from:\
  \ SALES.price\n    to: SALES.price\n  - from: SALES.discount\n    to: SALES.discount\n\
  \  - from: SALES.date\n    to: SALES.date\n  - from: SALES.date\n    to: monthly_revenue\n\
  \    role: month\n\nIn this example, the time-based measure `monthly_revenue` is\
  \ represented as an empty item in the \"measures\" section. The calculation is defined\
  \ in the \"dependencies\" section, with the role \"month\" indicating that it is\
  \ a time-based measure based on the `date` attribute and the month granularity.\
  \ I see. Thank you for the explanation. One more question: How would you handle\
  \ a scenario where a measure is a rolling measure, i.e., a measure that is calculated\
  \ based on a moving window of data?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a table called\
  \ `SALES` with the following columns: `sale_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`,\
  \ `discount`, `date`. We want to calculate the `rolling_average_revenue` as the\
  \ average of the `total_revenue` for the last 7 days. How would you represent this\
  \ in the DFM schema?\n\nIn this case, the `rolling_average_revenue` is a rolling\
  \ measure based on the `date` attribute.\n\nHere's the YAML representation of the\
  \ `SALES` table:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n  - name: total_revenue\ndependencies:\n\
  \  - from: SALES.sale_id\n    to: SALES.sale_id\n  - from: SALES.product_id\n  \
  \  to: SALES.product_id\n  - from: SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.quantity\n  - from:\
  \ SALES.price\n    to: SALES.price\n  - from: SALES.discount\n    to: SALES.discount\n\
  \  - from: SALES.date\n    to: SALES.date\n\nIn this case, the `rolling_average_revenue`\
  \ is not a direct attribute of the `SALES` table, but rather a rolling measure based\
  \ on the `date` attribute. How would you represent this in the DFM schema?\n\nTo\
  \ handle a scenario where a measure is a rolling measure, you can add another empty\
  \ item in the \"measures\" section of the DFM schema, and then define the calculation\
  \ in the \"dependencies\" section. You can also include the time dimension and the\
  \ window size in the dependencies to specify the granularity of the measure and\
  \ the moving window.\n\nHere's the YAML representation of the `SALES` table with\
  \ the rolling measure:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n  - name: total_revenue\n\
  \  - name: rolling_average_revenue\ndependencies:\n  - from: SALES.sale_id\n   \
  \ to: SALES.sale_id\n  - from: SALES.product_id\n    to: SALES.product_id\n  - from:\
  \ SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.quantity\n  - from: SALES.price\n    to: SALES.price\n\
  \  - from: SALES.discount\n    to: SALES.discount\n  - from: SALES.date\n    to:\
  \ SALES.date\n  - from: SALES.date\n    to: rolling_average_revenue\n    role: rolling_average\n\
  \    window: 7\n\nIn this example, the rolling measure `rolling_average_revenue`\
  \ is represented as an empty item in the \"measures\" section. The calculation is\
  \ defined in the \"dependencies\" section, with the role \"rolling\\_average\" indicating\
  \ that it is a rolling measure based on the `date` attribute and the window size\
  \ of 7 days. I see. Thank you for the explanation. One more question: How would\
  \ you handle a scenario where a measure is a calculated measure based on multiple\
  \ tables?\n\nFor example, let's say we have three tables: `SALES`, `PRODUCTS`, and\
  \ `CUSTOMERS`. The `SALES` table has the following columns: `sale_id`, `product_id`,\
  \ `quantity`, `price`, `discount`, `date`. The `PRODUCTS` table has the following\
  \ columns: `product_id`, `product_name`, `category_id`. The `CUSTOMERS` table has\
  \ the following columns: `customer_id`, `customer_name`, `customer_email`. We want\
  \ to calculate the `average_revenue_per_category_per_customer` as the average of\
  \ the `total_revenue` for each sale, grouped by the `category_id` and `customer_id`.\
  \ How would you represent this in the DFM schema?\n\nIn this case, the `average_revenue_per_category_per_customer`\
  \ is a calculated measure based on multiple tables.\n\nHere's the YAML representation\
  \ of the `SALES`, `PRODUCTS`, and `CUSTOMERS` tables:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\n\
  measures:\n  - name: total_revenue\ndependencies:\n  - from: SALES.sale_id\n   \
  \ to: SALES.sale_id\n  - from: SALES.product_id\n    to: SALES.product_id\n  - from:\
  \ SALES.quantity\n    to: SALES.quantity\n  - from: SALES.price\n    to: SALES.price\n\
  \  - from: SALES.discount\n    to: SALES.discount\n  - from: SALES.date\n    to:\
  \ SALES.date\n\nfact:\n  name: PRODUCTS\nmeasures:\n  - name: num_sales\ndependencies:\n\
  \  - from: PRODUCTS.product_id\n    to: PRODUCTS.product_id\n\nfact:\n  name: CUSTOMERS\n\
  measures:\n  - name: num_purchases\ndependencies:\n  - from: CUSTOMERS.customer_id\n\
  \    to: CUSTOMERS.customer_id\n\nIn this case, the `average_revenue_per_category_per_customer`\
  \ is not a direct attribute of any of the tables, but rather a calculated measure\
  \ based on the `total_revenue`, `num_sales`, and `num_purchases` measures from the\
  \ `SALES`, `PRODUCTS`, and `CUSTOMERS` tables, respectively. How would you represent\
  \ this in the DFM schema?\n\nTo handle a scenario where a measure is a calculated\
  \ measure based on multiple tables, you can add another empty item in the \"measures\"\
  \ section of the DFM schema, and then define the calculation in the \"dependencies\"\
  \ section. You can also include the dependencies from multiple tables in the calculation.\n\
  \nHere's the YAML representation of the `SALES`, `PRODUCTS`, and `CUSTOMERS` tables\
  \ with the calculated measure:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n  - name: total_revenue\n\
