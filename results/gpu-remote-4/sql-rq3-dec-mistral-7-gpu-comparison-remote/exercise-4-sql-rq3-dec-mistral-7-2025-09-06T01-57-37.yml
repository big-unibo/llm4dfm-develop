  \ ARRIVALS.Score Thank you for the response. I have one more question. In the YAML\
  \ representation, how do we handle the case where a fact table has multiple measures?\n\
  \nFor example, let's say we have a fact table called \"Sales\" with two measures:\
  \ \"Revenue\" and \"Quantity\". How would we represent this in the YAML?\n\nHere's\
  \ the YAML representation for the \"Sales\" fact table with only one measure:\n\n\
  fact:\n name: Sales\n measures:\n - name: Revenue\n\nHow would we modify this to\
  \ include the \"Quantity\" measure as well?\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\nfact:\n name:\
  \ Sales\n measures:\n - name: Revenue\n - name: Quantity\n\nThis is correct. You\
  \ have correctly represented the \"Sales\" fact table with two measures: \"Revenue\"\
  \ and \"Quantity\". In the YAML representation, you simply list each measure as\
  \ a separate item within the \"measures\" array, each with its own \"name\" tag.\n\
  \nHere's an example with three measures:\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n measures:\n -\
  \ name: Revenue\n - name: Quantity\n - name: Profit\n\nIn this example, the \"Sales\"\
  \ fact table has three measures: \"Revenue\", \"Quantity\", and \"Profit\". Each\
  \ measure is listed as a separate item within the \"measures\" array, with its own\
  \ \"name\" tag. I see. Thank you for the clarification.\n\nOne more question: In\
  \ the YAML representation, how do we handle the case where a dimension table has\
  \ multiple attributes?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a dimension table called\
  \ \"Customers\" with two attributes: \"CustomerID\" and \"CustomerName\". How would\
  \ we represent this in the YAML?\n\nHere's the YAML representation for the \"Customers\"\
  \ dimension table with only one attribute:\n\ndimension:\n name: Customers\n attributes:\n\
  \ - name: CustomerID\n\nHow would we modify this to include the \"CustomerName\"\
  \ attribute as well?\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\ndimension:\n name: Customers\n attributes:\n\
  \ - name: CustomerID\n - name: CustomerName\n\nThis is correct. You have correctly\
  \ represented the \"Customers\" dimension table with two attributes: \"CustomerID\"\
  \ and \"CustomerName\". In the YAML representation, you simply list each attribute\
  \ as a separate item within the \"attributes\" array, each with its own \"name\"\
  \ tag.\n\nHere's an example with three attributes:\n\ndimension:\n name: Customers\n\
  \ attributes:\n - name: CustomerID\n - name: CustomerName\n - name: CustomerAddress\n\
  \nIn this example, the \"Customers\" dimension table has three attributes: \"CustomerID\"\
  , \"CustomerName\", and \"CustomerAddress\". Each attribute is listed as a separate\
  \ item within the \"attributes\" array, with its own \"name\" tag. I see. Thank\
  \ you for the explanation.\n\nOne more question: In the YAML representation, how\
  \ do we handle the case where a fact table has multiple dimensions?\n\nFor example,\
  \ let's say we have a fact table called \"Sales\" with two dimensions: \"Time\"\
  \ and \"Product\". How would we represent this in the YAML?\n\nHere's the YAML representation\
  \ for the \"Sales\" fact table with only one dimension:\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n\
  \ dimensions:\n - name: Time\n\nHow would we modify this to include the \"Product\"\
  \ dimension as well?\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n dimensions:\n\
  \ - name: Time\n - name: Product\n\nThis is correct. You have correctly represented\
  \ the \"Sales\" fact table with two dimensions: \"Time\" and \"Product\". In the\
  \ YAML representation, you simply list each dimension as a separate item within\
  \ the \"dimensions\" array, each with its own \"name\" tag.\n\nHere's an example\
  \ with three dimensions:\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n dimensions:\n - name: Time\n -\
  \ name: Product\n - name: Store\n\nIn this example, the \"Sales\" fact table has\
  \ three dimensions: \"Time\", \"Product\", and \"Store\". Each dimension is listed\
  \ as a separate item within the \"dimensions\" array, with its own \"name\" tag.\
  \ I see. Thank you for the explanation.\n\nOne more question: In the YAML representation,\
  \ how do we handle the case where a dimension table has multiple hierarchies?\n\n\
  For example, let's say we have a dimension table called \"Product\" with two hierarchies:\
  \ \"Category\" and \"Subcategory\". How would we represent this in the YAML?\n\n\
  Here's the YAML representation for the \"Product\" dimension table with only one\
  \ hierarchy:\n\ndimension:\n name: Product\n hierarchies:\n - name: Category\n\n\
  How would we modify this to include the \"Subcategory\" hierarchy as well?\n\nThank\
  \ you!\n\n---\n\ndimension:\n name: Product\n hierarchies:\n - name: Category\n\
  \ - name: Subcategory\n\nThis is correct. You have correctly represented the \"\
  Product\" dimension table with two hierarchies: \"Category\" and \"Subcategory\"\
  . In the YAML representation, you simply list each hierarchy as a separate item\
  \ within the \"hierarchies\" array, each with its own \"name\" tag.\n\nHere's an\
  \ example with three hierarchies:\n\ndimension:\n name: Product\n hierarchies:\n\
  \ - name: Category\n - name: Subcategory\n - name: Brand\n\nIn this example, the\
  \ \"Product\" dimension table has three hierarchies: \"Category\", \"Subcategory\"\
  , and \"Brand\". Each hierarchy is listed as a separate item within the \"hierarchies\"\
  \ array, with its own \"name\" tag. I see. Thank you for the explanation.\n\nOne\
  \ more question: In the YAML representation, how do we handle the case where a fact\
  \ table has multiple measures and multiple dimensions?\n\nFor example, let's say\
  \ we have a fact table called \"Sales\" with two measures: \"Revenue\" and \"Quantity\"\
  , and two dimensions: \"Time\" and \"Product\". How would we represent this in the\
  \ YAML?\n\nHere's the YAML representation for the \"Sales\" fact table with only\
  \ one measure and one dimension:\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n measures:\n - name: Revenue\n\
  \ dimensions:\n - name: Time\n\nHow would we modify this to include the \"Quantity\"\
  \ measure and the \"Product\" dimension as well?\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\nfact:\n\
  \ name: Sales\n measures:\n - name: Revenue\n - name: Quantity\n dimensions:\n -\
  \ name: Time\n - name: Product\n\nThis is correct. You have correctly represented\
  \ the \"Sales\" fact table with two measures: \"Revenue\" and \"Quantity\", and\
  \ two dimensions: \"Time\" and \"Product\". In the YAML representation, you simply\
  \ list each measure as a separate item within the \"measures\" array, each with\
  \ its own \"name\" tag, and list each dimension as a separate item within the \"\
  dimensions\" array, each with its own \"name\" tag.\n\nHere's an example with three\
  \ measures and three dimensions:\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n measures:\n - name: Revenue\n\
  \ - name: Quantity\n - name: Profit\n dimensions:\n - name: Time\n - name: Product\n\
  \ - name: Store\n\nIn this example, the \"Sales\" fact table has three measures:\
  \ \"Revenue\", \"Quantity\", and \"Profit\", and three dimensions: \"Time\", \"\
  Product\", and \"Store\". Each measure is listed as a separate item within the \"\

  \ and one hierarchy:\n\ndimension:\n name: Customers\n attributes:\n - name: CustomerID\n\
  \ hierarchies:\n - name: Region\n\nHow would we modify this to include the \"CustomerName\"\
  \ attribute and the \"Country\" hierarchy as well?\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\ndimension:\n\
  \ name: Customers\n attributes:\n - name: CustomerID\n - name: CustomerName\n hierarchies:\n\
  \ - name: Region\n - name: Country\n\nThis is correct. You have correctly represented\

  \ the case where a fact table has multiple measures, multiple dimensions, and multiple\
  \ hierarchies in the dimension tables?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a fact\
  \ table called \"Sales\" with three measures: \"Revenue\", \"Quantity\", and \"\
  Profit\", and two dimensions: \"Time\" and \"Product\", and the \"Product\" dimension\
  \ table has two hierarchies: \"Category\" and \"Subcategory\". How would we represent\

  \nThank you!\n\n---\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n measures:\n - name: Revenue\n - name:\

  \ name: Product\n attributes:\n - name: ProductID\n - name: ProductName\n hierarchies:\n\
  \ - name: Category\n - name: Subcategory\n\nThis is correct. You have correctly\
  \ represented the \"Sales\" fact table with three measures: \"Revenue\", \"Quantity\"\
  , and \"Profit\", and two dimensions: \"Time\" and \"Product\", and the \"Product\"\
  \ dimension table with two attributes: \"ProductID\" and \"ProductName\", and two\
  \ hierarchies: \"Category\" and \"Subcategory\". In the YAML representation, you\

  \ item within the \"attributes\" array, each with its own \"name\" tag, and list\
  \ each hierarchy as a separate item within the \"hierarchies\" array, each with\

  \ and three hierarchies in the dimension tables:\n\nfact:\n name: Sales\n measures:\n\
  \ - name: Revenue\n - name: Quantity\n - name: Profit\n dimensions:\n - name: Time\n\

  \ - name: StoreID\n - name: StoreName\n hierarchies:\n - name: Region\n - name:\
  \ Country\n\nIn this example, the \"Sales\" fact table has three measures: \"Revenue\"\
  , \"Quantity\", and \"Profit\", and three dimensions: \"Time\", \"Product\", and\
  \ \"Store\". The \"Product\" dimension table has three attributes: \"ProductID\"\
  , \"ProductName\", and \"ProductBrand\", and three hierarchies: \"Category\", \"\
  Subcategory\", and \"Brand\". The \"Store\" dimension table has two attributes:\
  \ \"StoreID\" and \"StoreName\", and two hierarchies: \"Region\" and \"Country\"\
  . Each measure is listed as a separate item within the \"measures\" array, each\
  \ with its own \"name\" tag, each dimension is listed as a separate item within\

  \ YAML representation, how do we handle the case where a dimension table has multiple\
  \ attributes and multiple hierarchies, and some of the hierarchies are optional?\n\
  \nFor example, let's say we have a dimension table called \"Customers\" with three\
  \ attributes: \"CustomerID\", \"CustomerName\", and \"CustomerAddress\", and three\
  \ hierarchies: \"Region\", \"Country\", and \"City\". However, the \"City\" hierarchy\
  \ is optional, meaning that not all customers have a city associated with them.\
  \ How would we represent this in the YAML?\n\nHere's the YAML representation for\
  \ the \"Customers\" dimension table with all hierarchies required:\n\ndimension"
