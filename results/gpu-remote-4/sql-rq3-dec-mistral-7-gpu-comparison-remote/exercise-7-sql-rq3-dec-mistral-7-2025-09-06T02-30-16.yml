  \ Thank you for the response. I have one more question. How would the YAML representation\
  \ look like if we wanted to include the hierarchy of the dimensions? For example,\
  \ in the car rental example, we could have a hierarchy for the car brand, where\
  \ each brand belongs to a manufacturer.\n\nLet's assume we have a table `MANUFACTURERS`\
  \ with the following schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE MANUFACTURERS (\nmanufacturerId INT\
  \ PRIMARY KEY,\nmanufacturerName VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE CAR_MANUFACTURERS\
  \ (\nmanufacturerId INT,\ncarBrandId INT,\nPRIMARY KEY (manufacturerId, carBrandId),\n\
  FOREIGN KEY (manufacturerId) REFERENCES MANUFACTURERS(manufacturerId)\n);\n\nCREATE\
  \ TABLE CAR_BRANDS (\ncarBrandId INT PRIMARY KEY,\ncarBrandName VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\
  \nIn this case, the hierarchy would be:\n\n- Manufacturer\n  - Car Brand\n\nHow\
  \ would the YAML representation look like?\n\nPlease apply this to the car rental\
  \ example, and create the YAML representation of the resulting DFM schema with the\
  \ hierarchy for the car brand. Return only the YAML without any further information/explanation.\n\
  \nThe following logical schema describes an operational database for rentals.\n\n\
  CREATE TABLE RENTAL_OFFICES (\nOfficeName VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,\nCity VARCHAR(255),\n\
  Area VARCHAR(255),\nState VARCHAR(255),\nCountry VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE\
  \ CARS (\nPlate VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,\nCategory VARCHAR(255),\nModel VARCHAR(255),\n\
  Brand VARCHAR(255),\nFuel VARCHAR(255),\nRegistrationDate DATE\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE\
  \ HAVE_OPTIONAL (\nPlate VARCHAR(255),\nOptional VARCHAR(255),\nPRIMARY KEY (Plate,\
  \ Optional),\nFOREIGN KEY (Plate) REFERENCES CARS(Plate)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE RENTALS\
  \ (\nPlate VARCHAR(255),\nPickupDate DATE,\nDropoffDate DATE,\nPickupPlace VARCHAR(255),\n\
  DropoffPlace VARCHAR(255),\nMiles INT,\nPRIMARY KEY (Plate, PickupDate),\nFOREIGN\
  \ KEY (Plate) REFERENCES CARS(Plate),\nFOREIGN KEY (PickupPlace) REFERENCES RENTAL_OFFICES(OfficeName),\n\
  FOREIGN KEY (DropoffPlace) REFERENCES RENTAL_OFFICES(OfficeName)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE\
  \ DRIVERS (\nLicenseNumber VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,\nLicenseExpiration DATE,\n\
  DriverName VARCHAR(255),\nBirthdate DATE\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE DRIVE (\nLicenseNumber\
  \ VARCHAR(255),\nPlate VARCHAR(255),\nPickupDate DATE,\nPRIMARY KEY (LicenseNumber,\
  \ Plate, PickupDate),\nFOREIGN KEY (LicenseNumber) REFERENCES DRIVERS(LicenseNumber),\n\
  FOREIGN KEY (Plate, PickupDate) REFERENCES RENTALS(Plate, PickupDate)\n);\n\nCREATE\
  \ TABLE INSURANCES (\nRisk VARCHAR(255),\nPlate VARCHAR(255),\nPickupDate DATE,\n\
  Cost DECIMAL(10, 2),\nPRIMARY KEY (Risk, Plate, PickupDate),\nFOREIGN KEY (Plate,\
  \ PickupDate) REFERENCES RENTALS(Plate, PickupDate)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE PAYMENTS\
  \ (\nPlate VARCHAR(255),\nPickupDate DATE,\nAmount DECIMAL(10, 2),\nDiscount DECIMAL(10,\
  \ 2),\nPaymentMode VARCHAR(255),\nPRIMARY KEY (Plate, PickupDate),\nFOREIGN KEY\
  \ (Plate, PickupDate) REFERENCES RENTALS(Plate, PickupDate)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE\
  \ MANUFACTURERS (\nmanufacturerId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nmanufacturerName VARCHAR(100)\n\
  );\n\nCREATE TABLE CAR_MANUFACTURERS (\nmanufacturerId INT,\ncarBrandId INT,\nPRIMARY\
  \ KEY (manufacturerId, carBrandId),\nFOREIGN KEY (manufacturerId) REFERENCES MANUFACTURERS(manufacturerId)\n\
  );\n\nCREATE TABLE CAR_BRANDS (\ncarBrandId INT PRIMARY KEY,\ncarBrandName VARCHAR(100)\n\
