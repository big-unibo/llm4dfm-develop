  \nThis YAML representation describes a multidimensional cube for credit card purchases,\
  \ with the fact table named \"PURCHASES\". The measures in the cube are the amount\
  \ of each purchase. The dimensions are the attributes of the tables HOLDERS, CARD\\\
  _TYPES, STORES, CREDIT\\_CARDS, and PURCHASES. The relationships between the dimensions\
  \ are defined by the FDs in the given source schema. For example, the relationship\
  \ between the HOLDERS and CREDIT\\_CARDS tables is defined by the foreign key constraint\
  \ between the HolderCode column in the HOLDERS table and the HolderCode column in\
  \ the CREDIT\\_CARDS table. Similarly, the relationship between the CREDIT\\_CARDS\
  \ and PURCHASES tables is defined by the foreign key constraint between the CCNumber\
  \ column in the CREDIT\\_CARDS table and the CCNumber column in the PURCHASES table.\
  \ The relationships between the other tables are defined in a similar manner. The\
  \ YAML representation provides a clear and concise way to represent the structure\
  \ of the multidimensional cube and the relationships between its dimensions. I'm\
  \ glad I could help clarify the YAML representation of the DFM schema for the given\
  \ source schema. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel\
  \ free to ask!\n\nIn general, the process of designing a DFM schema involves identifying\
  \ the fact table and measures, as well as the dimensions and their relationships.\
  \ This can be done by analyzing the source schema and identifying the functional\
  \ dependencies between the tables and their columns. Once the DFM schema is designed,\
  \ it can be used to build a multidimensional cube that allows for efficient analysis\
  \ and reporting of the data.\n\nIn the given example, the fact table is PURCHASES,\
  \ and the measures are the amount of each purchase. The dimensions are the attributes\
  \ of the tables HOLDERS, CARD\\_TYPES, STORES, CREDIT\\_CARDS, and PURCHASES. The\
  \ relationships between the dimensions are defined by the FDs in the given source\
  \ schema. For example, the relationship between the HOLDERS and CREDIT\\_CARDS tables\
  \ is defined by the foreign key constraint between the HolderCode column in the\
  \ HOLDERS table and the HolderCode column in the CREDIT\\_CARDS table. Similarly,\
  \ the relationship between the CREDIT\\_CARDS and PURCHASES tables is defined by\
  \ the foreign key constraint between the CCNumber column in the CREDIT\\_CARDS table\
  \ and the CCNumber column in the PURCHASES table. The relationships between the\
  \ other tables are defined in a similar manner.\n\nBy using a DFM schema, it is\
  \ possible to build a multidimensional cube that allows for efficient analysis and\
  \ reporting of the data. For example, it is possible to analyze the sales of a particular\
  \ type of credit card by a specific holder at a particular store, or to compare\
  \ the sales of different types of credit cards across different regions. The DFM\
  \ schema provides a clear and concise way to represent the structure of the multidimensional\
  \ cube and the relationships between its dimensions, making it easier to build and\
  \ query the cube. I'm glad I could help clarify the DFM schema and its use in building\
  \ a multidimensional cube.\n\nTo summarize, the DFM schema is a way of organizing\
  \ data into a multidimensional cube, where the fact table represents the measures\
  \ (i.e., the data that is being analyzed), and the dimensions represent the attributes\
  \ of the tables in the source schema. The relationships between the dimensions are\
  \ defined by the functional dependencies in the source schema. By using a DFM schema,\

  _CARDS tables is defined by the foreign key constraint between the HolderCode column\
