  \ Thank you for the response. I have one more question. How would you handle a scenario\
  \ where a fact table has multiple measures and a single dimension?\n\nFor example,\
  \ let's say we have a fact table called `SALES` with the following columns: `storeId`,\
  \ `productId`, `quantitySold`, `revenue`, `discount`, `date`. Here, `storeId` and\
  \ `productId` are the dimensions, and `quantitySold`, `revenue`, `discount`, and\
  \ `date` are the measures.\n\nIn this case, how would the YAML representation of\
  \ the DFM schema look like?\n\nPlease provide the YAML representation for the given\
  \ example.\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n  - name: quantitySold\n  - name:\
  \ revenue\n  - name: discount\n  - name: date\ndimensions:\n  - name: storeId\n\
  \  - name: productId\n\nIn this case, the YAML representation would remain the same\
  \ as provided in your example, with the addition of the measures under the \"measures\"\
  \ tag. The \"dimensions\" tag would still contain the names of the dimensions (`storeId`\
  \ and `productId` in this case). The measures (`quantitySold`, `revenue`, `discount`,\
  \ and `date`) would be listed under the \"measures\" tag. Here is the updated YAML\
  \ representation:\n\nfact:\n  name: SALES\nmeasures:\n  - name: quantitySold\n \
  \ - name: revenue\n  - name: discount\n  - name: date\ndimensions:\n  - name: storeId\n\
  \  - name: productId I see, thank you for the clarification. I have one more question.\
  \ How would you handle a scenario where a fact table has multiple dimensions and\
  \ multiple measures?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a fact table called `EMPLOYEE_PERFORMANCE`\
  \ with the following columns: `employeeId`, `departmentId`, `year`, `month`, `sales`,\
  \ `commission`, `bonus`, `averageRating`, `numberOfComplaints`. Here, `employeeId`\
  \ and `departmentId` are the dimensions, and `sales`, `commission`, `bonus`, `averageRating`,\
  \ and `numberOfComplaints` are the measures.\n\nIn this case, how would the YAML\
  \ representation of the DFM schema look like?\n\nPlease provide the YAML representation\
  \ for the given example.\n\nfact:\n  name: EMPLOYEE_PERFORMANCE\nmeasures:\n  -\
  \ name: sales\n  - name: commission\n  - name: bonus\n  - name: averageRating\n\
  \  - name: numberOfComplaints\ndimensions:\n  - name: employeeId\n  - name: departmentId\n\
  \nIn this case, the YAML representation would remain the same as provided in your\
  \ example, with the addition of the measures under the \"measures\" tag and the\
  \ dimensions under the \"dimensions\" tag. Here is the updated YAML representation:\n\
  \nfact:\n  name: EMPLOYEE_PERFORMANCE\nmeasures:\n  - name: sales\n  - name: commission\n\
  \  - name: bonus\n  - name: averageRating\n  - name: numberOfComplaints\ndimensions:\n\
  \  - name: employeeId\n  - name: departmentId I see, thank you for the explanation.\
  \ I have one more question. How would you handle a scenario where a fact table has\
  \ a composite primary key, and the dimensions are based on the individual components\
  \ of the composite primary key?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a fact table called\
  \ `ORDER_DETAILS` with the following columns: `orderId`, `productId`, `quantity`,\
  \ `price`, `discount`, `date`. Here, `orderId` is a composite primary key consisting\
  \ of `orderId` and `customerId`, and `productId` is the dimension.\n\nIn this case,\
  \ how would the YAML representation of the DFM schema look like?\n\nPlease provide\
  \ the YAML representation for the given example.\n\nfact:\n  name: ORDER_DETAILS\n\
  measures:\n  - name: quantity\n  - name: price\n  - name: discount\n  - name: date\n\
  dimensions:\n  - name: productId\n\nIn this case, the YAML representation would\
  \ need to be updated to reflect the composite primary key of the `ORDER_DETAILS`\
  \ fact table. Here is the updated YAML representation:\n\nfact:\n  name: ORDER_DETAILS\n\
  measures:\n  - name: quantity\n  - name: price\n  - name: discount\n  - name: date\n\
  dimensions:\n  - name: orderId_customerId\n    attributes:\n      - name: orderId\n\
  \      - name: customerId\n  - name: productId\n\nIn this example, the \"dimensions\"\
  \ tag contains two entries. The first entry has a name of `orderId_customerId` and\
  \ an \"attributes\" tag that lists the individual components of the composite primary\
  \ key (`orderId` and `customerId`). The second entry has a name of `productId` as\
  \ before. This YAML representation indicates that the `ORDER_DETAILS` fact table\
  \ has a composite primary key consisting of `orderId` and `customerId`, and the\
  \ dimension is based on the `productId` column. I see, thank you for the explanation.\
  \ I have one more question. How would you handle a scenario where a fact table has\
  \ a composite primary key, and the dimensions are based on the individual components\
  \ of the composite primary key, but the fact table also has additional columns that\
  \ are not part of the composite primary key and should be included as measures?\n\
  \nFor example, let's say we have a fact table called `ORDER_DETAILS` with the following\
  \ columns: `orderId`, `customerId`, `productId`, `quantity`, `price`, `discount`,\
  \ `date`, `shippingCost`. Here, `orderId` is a composite primary key consisting\
  \ of `orderId` and `customerId`, and `productId` is the dimension.\n\nIn this case,\
  \ how would the YAML representation of the DFM schema look like?\n\nPlease provide\
  \ the YAML representation for the given example.\n\nfact:\n  name: ORDER_DETAILS\n\
  measures:\n  - name: quantity\n  - name: price\n  - name: discount\n  - name: date\n\
  \  - name: shippingCost\ndimensions:\n  - name: orderId_customerId\n    attributes:\n\
  \      - name: orderId\n      - name: customerId\n  - name: productId\n\nIn this\
  \ case, the YAML representation would be similar to the previous example, but with\
  \ the addition of the `shippingCost` measure under the \"measures\" tag. Here is\
  \ the updated YAML representation:\n\nfact:\n  name: ORDER_DETAILS\nmeasures:\n\
  \  - name: quantity\n  - name: price\n  - name: discount\n  - name: date\n  - name:\
  \ shippingCost\ndimensions:\n  - name: orderId_customerId\n    attributes:\n   \
  \   - name: orderId\n      - name: customerId\n  - name: productId\n\nThis YAML\
  \ representation indicates that the `ORDER_DETAILS` fact table has a composite primary\
  \ key consisting of `orderId` and `customerId`, and the dimension is based on the\
  \ `productId` column. Additionally, the fact table has additional columns (`quantity`,\
  \ `price`, `discount`, `date`, and `shippingCost`) that are included as measures\
  \ in the DFM schema. I see, thank you for the explanation. I have one more question.\

  \ on the `productId` column. Additionally, the fact table has additional columns\
  \ (`quantity`, `price`, `discount`, `date`, `shippingCost`, and `shippingMethod`)\
  \ that are included as measures in the DFM schema. The `shippingCost` and `shippingMethod`\
  \ columns are also included as a separate dimension with the name `shippingCost`\
  \ and the attributes `shippingCost` and `shippingMethod`. I see, thank you for the\
  \ explanation. I have one more question. How would you handle a scenario where a\

  \ with the following columns: `orderId`, `customerId`, `productId`, `quantity`,\
  \ `price`, `discount`, `date`, `shippingCost`, `shippingMethod`, `tags`. Here, `orderId`\

  \ shippingMethod\n  - name: tags\n    attributes:\n      - name: tag\n\nIn this\
  \ case, the YAML representation would be updated to include the `tags` column as\
  \ a separate dimension with the name `tags` and the attribute `tag`. However, since\
  \ the `tags` column can have multiple values, we would need to use a different approach\
  \ to represent this in the YAML. One possible approach would be to use a list of\
  \ tags for each fact, like this:\n\nfact:\n  name: ORDER_DETAILS\nmeasures:\n  -\
  \ name: quantity\n  - name: price\n  - name: discount\n  - name: date\n  - name:\
  \ shippingCost\ndimensions:\n  - name: orderId_customerId\n    attributes:\n   \
  \   - name: orderId\n      - name: customerId\n  - name: productId\n  - name: shippingCost\n\
  \    attributes:\n      - name: shippingCost\n      - name: shippingMethod\n  -\
  \ name: tags\n    attributes:\n      - name: tag\n      type: list\n\nThis YAML\
  \ representation indicates that the `ORDER_DETAILS` fact table has a composite primary\
  \ key consisting of `orderId` and `customerId`, and the dimension is based on the\
  \ `productId` column. Additionally, the fact table has additional columns (`quantity`,\
  \ `price`, `discount`, `date`, `shippingCost`, `shippingMethod`, and `tags`) that\
  \ are included as measures in the DFM schema. The `shippingCost` and `shippingMethod`\
  \ columns are also included as a separate dimension with the name `shippingCost`\
  \ and the attributes `shippingCost` and `shippingMethod`. The `tags` column is included\
  \ as a separate dimension with the name `tags` and the attribute `tag`, and the\
  \ type is set to `list` to indicate that it can have multiple values. I see, thank\
