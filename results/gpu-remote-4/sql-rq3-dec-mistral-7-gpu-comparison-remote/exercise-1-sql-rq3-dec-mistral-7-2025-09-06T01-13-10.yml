  \ response. I have one more question. In the example you provided, the measures\
  \ are listed under the \"measures\" tag, but in the first example, the measures\
  \ were not listed under the \"measures\" tag. Why is that?\n\nIn the first example,\
  \ the measures were listed directly under the \"fact\" tag, while in the second\
  \ and third examples, they were listed under the \"measures\" tag. Is there a specific\
  \ reason for this difference?\n\nAlso, in the first example, the \"dependencies\"\
  \ tag only included dependencies between the fact and the dimensions, but in the\
  \ second and third examples, it included dependencies between the dimensions as\
  \ well. Is there a specific rule for when to include dependencies between dimensions\
  \ and when not to?\n\nLastly, in the first example, the \"dependencies\" tag included\
  \ the role of the attribute, but in the second and third examples, it did not. Is\
  \ there a specific rule for when to include the role of the attribute and when not\
  \ to?\n\nI apologize for any confusion, and thank you for your help.\n\nRegarding\
  \ the differences in the YAML structure between the examples, the structure may\
  \ vary slightly depending on the specific requirements and conventions of each example.\
  \ However, in general, the YAML structure for a DFM schema follows a common pattern:\n\
  \n1. The \"fact\" tag includes the name of the fact table and any measures associated\
  \ with it. In the first example, the measures were listed directly under the \"\
  fact\" tag because there were only a few measures and it was more concise to list\
  \ them there. In the second and third examples, the measures were listed under a\
  \ separate \"measures\" tag to better organize the schema and to accommodate more\
  \ complex measure relationships.\n2. The \"dependencies\" tag includes all the dependencies\
  \ between the fact and the dimensions. In the first example, the \"dependencies\"\
  \ tag only included dependencies between the fact and the dimensions because there\
  \ were no dependencies between the dimensions themselves. In the second and third\
  \ examples, dependencies between the dimensions were included because they were\
  \ necessary to fully describe the relationships between the tables.\n3. The \"role\"\
  \ tag is used to specify the role of an attribute in a dependency. For example,\
  \ in the first example, the \"role\" tag was used to specify that the \"type\" attribute\
  \ in the \"ARTICLES\" table was a foreign key referencing the \"typeId\" attribute\
  \ in the \"TYPES\" table. In the second and third examples, the \"role\" tag was\
  \ not used because it was not necessary to specify the role of the attributes in\
  \ the dependencies.\n\nIn summary, the structure of the YAML schema may vary depending\
  \ on the specific requirements and conventions of each example, but the common pattern\
  \ is to include a \"fact\" tag with any associated measures, a \"dependencies\"\
  \ tag with all the dependencies between the fact and the dimensions, and optionally\
  \ a \"role\" tag to specify the role of an attribute in a dependency. I see, thank\
  \ you for the explanation. One more question: In the first example, the \"dependencies\"\
  \ tag only included dependencies between the fact and the dimensions, but in the\
  \ second and third examples, it included dependencies between the dimensions as\
  \ well. Is there a specific rule for when to include dependencies between dimensions\
  \ and when not to?\n\nIn the first example, the \"dependencies\" tag included the\
  \ role of the attribute, but in the second and third examples, it did not. Is there\
  \ a specific rule for when to include the role of the attribute and when not to?\n\
  \nRegarding the inclusion of dependencies between dimensions, it depends on the\
  \ specific requirements and complexity of the schema. In general, if there are dependencies\
  \ between dimensions that are necessary to fully describe the relationships between\
  \ the tables, then those dependencies should be included in the \"dependencies\"\
  \ tag. However, if the dependencies between dimensions are not relevant to the analysis\
  \ or reporting requirements, then they may not be included.\n\nRegarding the inclusion\
  \ of the role of the attribute, it is generally recommended to include the role\
  \ of the attribute in the \"dependencies\" tag if it is necessary to clearly specify\
  \ the relationship between the attributes. For example, if an attribute is a foreign\
  \ key referencing another attribute, then the role of the attribute should be specified\
  \ to make it clear that it is a foreign key. However, if the role of the attribute\
  \ is not relevant to the analysis or reporting requirements, then it may not be\
  \ included.\n\nIn summary, the inclusion of dependencies between dimensions and\
  \ the role of the attribute in those dependencies depends on the specific requirements\
  \ and complexity of the schema, and may vary depending on the analysis or reporting\
  \ requirements. Thank you for your help. I have one more question: In the first\
  \ example, the \"fact\" tag only included the name of the fact table, while in the\
  \ second and third examples, it included the name of the fact table and the name\
  \ of the measures. Is there a specific rule for when to include the name of the\
  \ measures in the \"fact\" tag and when not to?\n\nRegarding the inclusion of the\
  \ name of the measures in the \"fact\" tag, it depends on the specific requirements\
  \ and complexity of the schema. In general, if there are only a few measures associated\
  \ with the fact table and they are straightforward, then it may be more concise\
  \ to list them directly under the \"fact\" tag. However, if there are many measures\
  \ or if the relationships between the measures are complex, then it may be more\
  \ appropriate to list them under a separate \"measures\" tag to better organize\
  \ the schema and to accommodate more complex measure relationships.\n\nIn summary,\
  \ the inclusion of the name of the measures in the \"fact\" tag depends on the specific\
  \ requirements and complexity of the schema, and may vary depending on the number\
  \ and complexity of the measures associated with the fact table. Thank you for your\
  \ help. I have one more question: In the first example, the \"fact\" tag only included\
