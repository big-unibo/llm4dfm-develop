  \ I apologize for the confusion in my previous message. I made a mistake in the\
  \ requirements. Here is the corrected version:\n\nDecision-makers are interested\
  \ in analyzing the daily presences of members at a crossfit box for trainings.\n\
  Members have a name and a surname, an address, a postal code, and live in a city;\n\
  they are described by their weight and height. Crossfit tranings follow a workout-of-the-day\
  \ (WOD),\nwhich is different every day; WODs have different types. On each day,\
  \ the WOD is repeated several times\nat different hours with different instructors.\
  \ Each member can have multiple presences in a day,\nbut each presence is for a\
  \ single training session.\n\nHere is the YAML representation of the resulting DFM\
