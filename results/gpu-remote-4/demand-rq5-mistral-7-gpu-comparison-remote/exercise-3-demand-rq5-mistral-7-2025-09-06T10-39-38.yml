  \ have one more question. How would the YAML representation change if we wanted\
  \ to include a measure that is a sum of the measures of child nodes? For example,\
  \ in the PURCHASE schema, we might want to have a total cost of purchases made by\
  \ a specific holder.\n\nIn this case, we would need to add a new measure that is\
  \ a sum of the cost measures of all the purchases made by the specific holder.\n\
  \nTo achieve this, we would need to add a new measure to the YAML representation,\
  \ and also modify the dependencies to include the measure we want to aggregate.\n\
  \nHere's an example of how the YAML representation might look like:\n\nfact:\n \
  \ name: PURCHASE\nmeasures:\n  - name: amount\n  - name: cost\n    aggregation:\

  \    to: store\n  - from: PURCHASE\n    to: creditCard\n    role: used\n  - from:\
  \ PURCHASE\n    to: date\n\nIn this example, the \"cost\" measure now has an \"\
  aggregation\" attribute set to \"sum\", and a new dependency is added from the PURCHASE\
  \ to the cost measure, with a role of \"purchaseCost\". This dependency indicates\
  \ that the cost measure is the sum of the cost measures of all the purchases made\
  \ by the specific holder.\n\nPlease confirm if this is correct, and if so, provide\
  \ an example of how the YAML representation might look like for the STREAM schema,\
  \ with a total duration of streams for a specific device.\n\nfact:\n  name: STREAM\n\

  \  - from: STREAM\n    to: subscription\n    role: subscriptionDuration\n  - from:\
  \ STREAM\n    to: device\n    role: deviceDuration\n\nIn this example, the \"duration\"\
  \ measure now has an \"aggregation\" attribute set to \"sum\", and three new dependencies\
  \ are added from the STREAM to the duration measure, with roles of \"streamDuration\"\
  , \"subscriptionDuration\", and \"deviceDuration\". These dependencies indicate\
  \ that the duration measure is the sum of the duration measures of all the streams,\
  \ subscriptions, and devices associated with the specific device. Yes, you are correct.\
  \ The YAML representation for the STREAM schema with a total duration of streams\
  \ for a specific device would look like this:\n\nfact:\n  name: STREAM\nmeasures:\n\
  \  - name: duration\n    aggregation: sum\ndependencies:\n  - from: subscription\n\

  \ STREAM\n    to: device\n    role: deviceDuration\n  - from: STREAM\n    to: duration\n\
  \    role: totalDuration\n\nIn this example, the \"duration\" measure now has an\
  \ \"aggregation\" attribute set to \"sum\", and a new dependency is added from the\
  \ STREAM to the duration measure, with a role of \"totalDuration\". This dependency\
  \ indicates that the totalDuration measure is the sum of the duration measures of\
  \ all the streams associated with the specific device. Thank you for your response.\
  \ I have one more question. How would the YAML representation change if we wanted\
