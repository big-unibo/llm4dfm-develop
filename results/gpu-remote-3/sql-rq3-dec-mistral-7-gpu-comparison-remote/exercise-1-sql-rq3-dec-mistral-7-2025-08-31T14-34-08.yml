  \ generate a YAML response for the following input.\n[/INST] Carry out supply-driven\
  \ conceptual\ndesign of a multidimensional cube using the DFM (Dimensional Fact\
  \ Model), starting from the given\nsource relational schema. \n\nData-driven conceptual\
  \ design of a multidimensional cube starting from a source relational schema S \n\
  should be carried out via the following steps.\n1. Find all the functional dependencies\
  \ (from here on, FDs) entailed by schema S, including \nthose that relate the primary\
  \ key of a relation R to the other attributes of R, \nthose that relate a composite\
  \ primary key to its component attributes, \nand those that relate a foreign key\
  \ F referencing relation R to the primary key of R.\nThe result should be a directed\
  \ and fully connected graph of FDs.\n2. For every pair of FDs F->K and K->A, where\
  \ F is a foreign key referencing relation R, \nK is the primary key of R, and A\
  \ is an attribute of R, replace F->K and K->A with F->A.\n3. Find the roots of the\
  \ obtained graph (i.e., the attributes that never appear on the right of an FD),\
  \ \npick the root that allows reaching the greatest number of attributes by navigation\
  \ FDs in the \ncorrect direction, and draw the corresponding tree (i.e., exclude\
  \ from the graph all FDs that cannot\nbe navigated from the chosen root); the root\
  \ must be renamed with the name of the corresponding relation R.\n\nThe output I\
  \ expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: \n(1) there is a \"fact\"\
  \ tag including a \"name\" tag, listing the name of the root;\n(2) all measures\
  \ (i.e., all numerical attributes directly connected to the root)\nare listed inside\
  \ a \"measures\" tag, each is an empty item containing a \"name\" tag; \n(3) all\
  \ functional dependencies between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside a\
  \ \"dependencies\" tag: \neach is an empty item containing a \"from\" tag, listing\
  \ the finer attribute(s), a \"to\" tag, listing \nthe coarser attribute, and optionally\
  \ a \"role\" tag; \n(4) the \"dependencies\" list also includes an item from the\
  \ fact to each measure; \n(5) if a dependency is from and/or to a combination of\
  \ attributes, they should be comma-separated;\n(6) all attributes and measure names\
  \ must be prefixed by the name (in uppercases) of the table \nthey belong to (for\
  \ instance, PERSON.Address).</s>[INST] Let this relational schema be given:\n\n\

  After step 1, the list of FDs is the following:\n\n- PURCHASE.storeId,PURCHASE.artId,PURCHASE.date->PURCHASE.storeId\n\
  - PURCHASE.storeId,PURCHASE.artId,PURCHASE.date->PURCHASE.artId\n- PURCHASE.storeId,PURCHASE.artId,PURCHASE.date->PURCHASE.date\n\

  - REGIONS.regId,REGIONS.state->REGIONS.regionName\n- REGIONS.state->REGIONS.country\n\
  \nAfter step 2, the list of FDs is changed as follows:\n\n- PURCHASE.storeId,PURCHASE.artId,PURCHASE.date->PURCHASE.storeId\
  \ and PURCHASE.storeId->STORES.storeId \nare replaced with PURCHASE.storeId,PURCHASE.artId,PURCHASE.date->STORES.storeId\
  \ \n- PURCHASE.storeId,PURCHASE.artId,PURCHASE.date->PURCHASE.artId and PURCHASE.artId->ARTICLES.artId\
  \ \nare replaced with PURCHASE.storeId,PURCHASE.artId,PURCHASE.date->ARTICLES.artId\
