- "<s>[INST] You are a data warehouse designer that outputs YAML-formatted data. Please\
  \ generate a YAML response for the following input.\n[/INST] Your task is to create\
  \ the conceptual schema for a multidimensional cube in a \ndemand-driven fashion,\
  \ i.e., starting from the end-user requirements, using the DFM. \nTo this end, keep\
  \ in mind that a DFM is a connected graph where the fact is a \nnode in which no\
  \ arcs enter. The fact is a business phenomenon the users wish to \nanalyze, e.g.,\
  \ sales, purchases, rentals, shipments. The arcs exiting the fact lead \neither\
  \ to measures (always numerical) or to dimensions (always categorical). \nThe arcs\
  \ within a hierarchy are always directed from the finer attribute towards \nthe\
  \ coarser one (e.g., date->month->year, product->category, \nstore->city->region->state->country->area).\
  \ This means that there is an arc from \nattribute \"a\" to attribute \"b\" when\
  \ one member of \"a\" is related to one member of \"b\", \nwhile one member of \"\
  b\" is related to many members of \"a\".\nWhen you have the same concept used twice\
  \ or more (e.g., \"delivery date\" and \n\"shipment date\"; \"city of birth\" and\
  \ \"city of residence\"), instead of keeping these \nattributes separate, you should\
  \ create two or more arcs reaching a single node \n(\"date\"; \"city\") and add\
  \ roles to the arcs (\"delivery\" and \"shipment\"; \"birth\" and \n\"residence\"\
  ). When the requirements specify that a concept is identified by an attribute \n\
  (e.g., \"Articles are identified by a code\"), do not create a node for the concept\
  \ \n(\"article\") but only for the identifier (\"article code\").\n\nThe output\
  \ I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: \n(1) the fact is a \"\
  fact\" tag including a \"name\" tag; \n(2) all measures are listed inside a \"measures\"\
  \ tag, each is an empty item containing \na \"name\" tag; \n(3) all many-to-one\
  \ relationships between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside \na \"dependencies\"\
  \ tag: each is an empty item containing a \"from\" tag, listing the finer \nattribute,\
  \ a \"to\" tag, listing the coarser attribute, and optionally a \"role\" tag; \n\
  (4) the \"dependencies\" list also includes an item from the fact to each dimension,\
  \ \nand one from the fact to each measure.\n\nLet these requirements be given:\n\
  Decision-makers are interested in analyzing, in terms of quantity and cost, the\
  \ shipments \nof articles made from a warehouse to another warehouse on a day-by-day\
  \ basis. \nA warehouse has a unique name, an address, and is located in a region\
  \ of a state (each \nstate is part of one country). Articles are identified by a\
  \ code and described by their \nnames and their types.\n\nHere, SHIPMENT is the\
  \ fact, while quantity and cost are numerical measures. \nArticle code, warehouse,\
  \ and day are dimensions. Since two warehouses are involved, \nthere are two arcs\
  \ from SHIPMENT to warehouse, with roles \"from\" and \"to\", respectively. \nThere\
  \ are arcs from warehouse to name, address, and region; from region to state and\
  \ \nfrom state to country. There are arcs from article code to article name and\
  \ type.\n\nThe YAML expression of the DFM schema obtained is the following:\n\n\
  fact:\n  name: SHIPMENT\nmeasures:\n  - name: quantity\n  - name: cost\ndependencies:\n\
  \  - from: articleCode\n    to: articleName\n  - from: articleCode\n    to: type\n\

  \ A device type belongs to a category. A user has a first name, a second name, a\
  \ birthdate, a gender, and lives in a nation. An episode has a number, a release\

  \ representation describes a multidimensional cube for analyzing staff transfers\
  \ between departments on a daily basis. The fact is named \"TRANSFER\", and it has\
  \ one measure, \"count\". The dimensions are \"employee\", \"currentDepartment\"\
  , \"division\", and \"date\". The arcs represent the relationships between these\
  \ dimensions. For example, there is an arc from \"employee\" to \"code\", \"name\"\
  , \"surname\", \"gender\", \"qualification\", \"recruitmentDate\", and \"currentDepartment\"\
  . Similarly, there is an arc from \"currentDepartment\" to \"departmentCode\", \"\
  departmentName\", and \"division\". There is also an arc from \"division\" to \"\
  divisionCode\", \"divisionName\", and \"manager\", which represents the manager\
  \ of the division, who is an employee. Finally, there is an arc from \"TRANSFER\"\
  \ to \"reason\" and \"date\". How would the YAML representation change if the decision-makers\
  \ are interested in analyzing the transfers of staff from one department to another\
  \ on a monthly basis instead of daily?\n\nTo change the YAML representation to analyze\
  \ staff transfers on a monthly basis instead of daily, we need to modify the \"\

  In this updated representation, the \"date\" dimension now has a property called\
