    "content": "Your task is to create the conceptual schema for a multidimensional cube in a demand-driven fashion, i.e., starting from the end-user requirements, using the DFM. To this end, keep in mind that a DFM is a connected graph where the fact is a node in which no arcs enter. The fact is a business phenomenon the users wish to analyze, e.g., sales, purchases, rentals, shipments. The arcs exiting the fact lead either to measures (always numerical) or to dimensions (always categorical). The arcs within a hierarchy are always directed from the finer attribute towards the coarser one (e.g., date->month->year, product->category, store->city->region->state->country->area). This means that there is an arc from attribute \"a\" to attribute \"b\" when one member of \"a\" is related to one member of \"b\", while one member of \"b\" is related to many members of \"a\". When you have the same concept used twice or more (e.g., \"delivery date\" and \"shipment date\"; \"city of birth\" and \"city of residence\"), instead of keeping these attributes separate, you should create two or more arcs reaching a single node (\"date\"; \"city\") and add roles to the arcs (\"delivery\" and \"shipment\"; \"birth\" and \"residence\"). When the requirements specify that a concept is identified by an attribute (e.g., \"Articles are identified by a code\"), do not create a node for the concept (\"article\") but only for the identifier (\"article code\"). The output I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: (1) the fact is a \"fact\" tag including a \"name\" tag; (2) all measures are listed inside a \"measures\" tag, each is an empty item containing a \"name\" tag; (3) all many-to-one relationships between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside a \"dependencies\" tag: each is an empty item containing a \"from\" tag, listing the finer attribute, a \"to\" tag, listing the coarser attribute, and optionally a \"role\" tag; (4) the \"dependencies\" list also includes an item from the fact to each dimension, and one from the fact to each measure."
