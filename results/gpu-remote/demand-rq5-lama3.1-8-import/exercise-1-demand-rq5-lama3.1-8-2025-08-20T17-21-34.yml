output:
- ? However, the name of the measure is empty. Based on the problem description, it
    seems that the measure should be "quantity" or "cost" but in this case, it seems
    that the measure is not specified. If we assume that the measure is "quantity",
    the corrected YAML response would be
  : null
  The previous response was not a valid YAML file. Here is the corrected YAML response: null
