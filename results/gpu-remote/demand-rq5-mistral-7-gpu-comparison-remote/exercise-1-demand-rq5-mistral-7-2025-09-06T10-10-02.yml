  \ \"supplier\" to \"city\" and \"address\", from \"software\" to \"description\"\

  \ that these are dimensions. The arcs within the hierarchy are directed from the\
  \ finer attribute towards the coarser one, such as \"computer\" to \"brand\" and\
  \ \"brand\" to \"supplier\". The roles are not specified in this example, as they\

  \ the DFM schema for the given source schema, where the fact is \"SOFTWARE\\_INSTALLATION\"\
  , the measures are \"count\", and the dimensions are \"computer\", \"brand\", \"\

  \ specified in this example, as they are not required for this particular schema.\n\
  \nHowever, it is worth noting that in a real-world scenario, the roles might be\
  \ important to distinguish between different types of relationships between the\
  \ same concepts. For example, if there are multiple types of software installations\
  \ (e.g., trial, full, update), it might be useful to have separate arcs from \"\
  SOFTWARE\\_INSTALLATION\" to \"software\" with different roles for each type of\
  \ installation. Similarly, if there are multiple suppliers for the same brand, it\
  \ might be useful to have separate arcs from \"brand\" to \"supplier\" with different\
  \ roles for each supplier.\n\nAdditionally, it is also possible to have multiple\
  \ arcs from the same concept to another concept, if the same concept is used in\
  \ different ways. For example, if the software is identified by both a name and\
  \ a version number, it might be useful to have separate arcs from \"software\" to\
  \ \"description\" and \"type\" with different roles for each attribute.\n\nOverall,\
  \ the roles and multiple arcs can provide additional information and flexibility\
  \ in the analysis of the data, and should be considered when designing the DFM schema.\n\
