  \n1. The YAML file is missing the root level.\n2. The YAML file should have a single\
  \ root level object with the key \"dfm\" and the value as the list of facts, measures,\
  \ and dependencies.\n3. The \"measures\" section should be a list of objects, each\
  \ with a \"name\" key and a value.\n4. The \"dependencies\" section should be a\
  \ list of objects, each with a \"from\" key, a \"to\" key, and optionally a \"role\"\
  \ key.\n5. The \"fact\" section should have a \"name\" key and a value.\n6. The\
  \ \"fact\" section should have a \"measures\" key, which is a list of measure names.\n\
  7. The \"fact\" section should have a \"dependencies\" key, which is a list of dependency\
  \ objects.\n8. The \"fact\" section should have a \"dimensions\" key, which is a\
  \ list of dimension names.\n9. The \"dimension\" section should have a \"name\"\
  \ key and a value.\n10. The \"dimension\" section should have a \"hierarchy\" key,\
  \ which is a list of hierarchy objects.\n11. The \"hierarchy\" object should have\
  \ a \"from\" key, a \"to\" key, and optionally a \"role\" key.\n\nHere is the corrected\
