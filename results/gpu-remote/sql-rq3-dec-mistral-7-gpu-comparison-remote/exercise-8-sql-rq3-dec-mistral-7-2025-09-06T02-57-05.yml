  \ BOARDING_CARD.boardingCardCode\n    to: CHECK_IN.numberOfBags Thank you for the\
  \ response. I have one more question. In the YAML representation of the DFM schema,\
  \ how would you represent a many-to-many relationship between two entities?\n\n\
  For example, let's consider the following source schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE STUDENT\
  \ (\nstudentId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nstudentName VARCHAR(100),\nstudentEmail VARCHAR(100)\n\
  );\n\nCREATE TABLE COURSE (\ncourseId INT PRIMARY KEY,\ncourseName VARCHAR(100),\n\
  courseDescription VARCHAR(255)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE ENROLLMENT (\nenrollmentId INT\
  \ PRIMARY KEY,\nstudentId INT,\ncourseId INT,\nFOREIGN KEY (studentId) REFERENCES\
  \ STUDENT(studentId),\nFOREIGN KEY (courseId) REFERENCES COURSE(courseId)\n);\n\n\
  In this case, the ENROLLMENT table represents the many-to-many relationship between\
  \ STUDENT and COURSE entities. How would you represent this relationship in the\
  \ YAML representation of the DFM schema?\n\nHere's a hint: You can use a list to\
  \ represent the many-to-many relationship.\n\nIn the YAML representation of the\
  \ DFM schema, the dependencies section for the STUDENT entity would look like this:\n\
  \n- from: ENROLLMENT.studentId\n  to: STUDENT.studentId\n\nAnd the dependencies\
  \ section for the COURSE entity would look like this:\n\n- from: ENROLLMENT.courseId\n\
  \  to: COURSE.courseId\n\nBut how would you represent the many-to-many relationship\
  \ itself in the YAML representation?\n\nThe answer is:\n\n- from: STUDENT.studentId\n\
  \  to: COURSE.courseId\n    through: ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId\n\nThis represents\
  \ that the STUDENT.studentId is related to multiple COURSE.courseId through the\
  \ ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId. Similarly, you can represent the other side of the many-to-many\
  \ relationship as follows:\n\n- from: COURSE.courseId\n  to: STUDENT.studentId\n\
  \    through: ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId\n\nThis represents that the COURSE.courseId\
  \ is related to multiple STUDENT.studentId through the ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId.\
  \ I see, thank you for the explanation. That makes sense.\n\nJust to clarify, in\
  \ the YAML representation, the \"through\" key is used to specify the join table\
  \ that connects the two entities in the many-to-many relationship. The \"from\"\
  \ and \"to\" keys specify the foreign keys in the two related tables that reference\
  \ the join table.\n\nSo, in the example you provided, the YAML representation of\
  \ the DFM schema would look like this:\n\nfact:\n  name: ENROLLMENT\nmeasures:\n\
  \  - name: ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId\ndependencies:\n  - from: STUDENT.studentId\n\
  \    to: COURSE.courseId\n      through: ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId\n  - from: COURSE.courseId\n\
  \    to: STUDENT.studentId\n      through: ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId\n\nThis represents\
  \ that the STUDENT.studentId is related to multiple COURSE.courseId through the\
  \ ENROLLMENT.enrollmentId, and vice versa.\n\nThank you for your help! You're welcome!\
