  ```\n\nThank you for bringing this to my attention, and I hope this clears up any\
  \ confusion. I have another question regarding the YAML structure. In the \"dependencies\"\
  \ section, it seems that the \"role\" tag is not used in the provided YAML. Is it\
  \ necessary to include the \"role\" tag in every dependency, or is it optional?\
  \ If it is optional, under what circumstances should it be used?\n\nThe \"role\"\
  \ tag is optional in the provided YAML. It is used to specify the role or relationship\
  \ between the \"from\" and \"to\" attributes in a dependency. For example, if there\
  \ is a many-to-one relationship between two attributes, the \"role\" tag can be\
  \ used to indicate which attribute is the \"one\" side of the relationship.\n\n\
  In the provided YAML, the \"role\" tag is not used because the relationships between\
  \ the attributes are one-to-one or one-to-many, and the relationships are clear\
  \ from the \"from\" and \"to\" attributes alone. However, if there is a need to\
  \ clarify the relationship between attributes, the \"role\" tag can be used.\n\n\
  Here is an example where the \"role\" tag is used to clarify the relationship between\
  \ attributes:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  -\n    from: ORDERS.orderId\n      to:\
  \ CUSTOMERS.customerId\n      role: customer_id\n  -\n    from: ORDERS.orderId\n\
  \      to: PRODUCTS.productId\n      role: product_id\n```\n\nIn this example, the\
  \ \"role\" tag is used to indicate that the \"customer\\_id\" attribute in the \"\
  CUSTOMERS\" table is the foreign key referencing the \"orderId\" attribute in the\
  \ \"ORDERS\" table, and the \"product\\_id\" attribute in the \"PRODUCTS\" table\
  \ is the foreign key referencing the \"orderId\" attribute in the \"ORDERS\" table.\
  \ This makes it clear that the \"orderId\" attribute in the \"ORDERS\" table is\
  \ the primary key, and the \"customer\\_id\" and \"product\\_id\" attributes in\
  \ the \"CUSTOMERS\" and \"PRODUCTS\" tables are foreign keys referencing the \"\
  orderId\" attribute in the \"ORDERS\" table. Thank you for the explanation. I have\
  \ one more question regarding the YAML structure. In the \"dependencies\" section,\
  \ it seems that the \"from\" and \"to\" tags are not always pointing to the same\
  \ table. For example, in the following dependency:\n\n```yaml\n  -\n    from: RENTALS.Plate\n\
  \      to: HAVE_OPTIONAL.Optional\n```\n\nThe \"from\" tag is pointing to the \"\
  RENTALS\" table, while the \"to\" tag is pointing to the \"HAVE\\_OPTIONAL\" table.\
  \ Is it possible to have dependencies between tables that are not directly related,\
  \ or should the \"from\" and \"to\" tags always point to the same table?\n\nIn the\
  \ provided YAML, the \"from\" and \"to\" tags can point to different tables, as\
  \ long as there is a foreign key relationship between the two tables. In this case,\
  \ the \"HAVE\\_OPTIONAL\" table has a foreign key column that references the \"\
  Plate\" column in the \"RENTALS\" table. This foreign key relationship allows us\
  \ to create a dependency between the two tables.\n\nHere is an example of a dependency\
  \ between two tables that are not directly related:\n\n```yaml\nCREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES\
  \ (\n    employeeId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    firstName VARCHAR(50),\n    lastName VARCHAR(50),\n\
  \    departmentId INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (departmentId) REFERENCES DEPARTMENTS(departmentId)\n\
  );\n\nCREATE TABLE DEPARTMENTS (\n    departmentId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    departmentName\
  \ VARCHAR(100),\n    managerId INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (managerId) REFERENCES EMPLOYEES(employeeId)\n\
  );\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"DEPARTMENTS\" table has a foreign key column that\
  \ references the \"employeeId\" column in the \"EMPLOYEES\" table. This foreign\
  \ key relationship allows us to create a dependency between the two tables, even\
  \ though they are not directly related.\n\nHere is the corresponding YAML representation:\n\
  \n```yaml\nfact:\n  name: EMPLOYEES\nmeasures:\n  - name: EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n\
  dependencies:\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId\n      to: EMPLOYEES.firstName\n \
  \ - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId\n      to: EMPLOYEES.lastName\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n\
  \      to: DEPARTMENTS.departmentName\n  - from: DEPARTMENTS.departmentId\n    \
  \  to: EMPLOYEES.managerId\n```\n\nIn this YAML representation, the \"from\" tag\
  \ is pointing to the \"EMPLOYEES\" table, while the \"to\" tag is pointing to the\
  \ \"DEPARTMENTS\" table. This is because there is a foreign key relationship between\
  \ the two tables, and we can create a dependency between them. I see, thank you\
  \ for the explanation. I have one more question regarding the YAML structure. In\
  \ the \"dependencies\" section, it seems that the \"from\" and \"to\" tags are not\
  \ always pointing to columns, but sometimes they are pointing to the entire table.\
  \ For example, in the following dependency:\n\n```yaml\n  -\n    from: RENTALS.Plate\n\
  \      to: CARS\n```\n\nThe \"from\" tag is pointing to the \"Plate\" column in\
  \ the \"RENTALS\" table, while the \"to\" tag is pointing to the entire \"CARS\"\
  \ table. Is it possible to have dependencies between tables that are not columns,\
  \ or should the \"from\" and \"to\" tags always point to columns?\n\nIn the provided\
  \ YAML, the \"from\" and \"to\" tags can point to columns or entire tables, depending\
  \ on the nature of the relationship between the tables. In this case, the \"CARS\"\
  \ table is related to the \"RENTALS\" table through the \"Plate\" column, which\
  \ is a foreign key in the \"RENTALS\" table referencing the primary key in the \"\
  CARS\" table.\n\nHere is an example of a dependency between two tables that is not\
  \ a column:\n\n```yaml\nCREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (\n    employeeId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n\
  \    firstName VARCHAR(50),\n    lastName VARCHAR(50),\n    departmentId INT,\n\
  \    FOREIGN KEY (departmentId) REFERENCES DEPARTMENTS(departmentId)\n);\n\nCREATE\
  \ TABLE DEPARTMENTS (\n    departmentId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    departmentName VARCHAR(100),\n\
  \    managerId INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (managerId) REFERENCES EMPLOYEES(employeeId)\n\
  );\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"DEPARTMENTS\" table is related to the \"EMPLOYEES\"\
  \ table through the \"managerId\" column, which is a foreign key in the \"DEPARTMENTS\"\
  \ table referencing the primary key in the \"EMPLOYEES\" table. However, we can\
  \ also create a dependency between the two tables as a whole, without specifying\
  \ a particular column:\n\n```yaml\nfact:\n  name: EMPLOYEES\nmeasures:\n "
