  \ response. I have one more question. How would you handle the case where a table\
  \ has multiple foreign keys referencing the same table?\n\nFor example, let's consider\
  \ the following source schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE ORDERS (\n    orderId INT PRIMARY\
  \ KEY,\n    customerId INT,\n    orderDate DATE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (customerId) REFERENCES\
  \ CUSTOMERS(customerId)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE LINE_ITEMS (\n    lineItemId INT PRIMARY\
  \ KEY,\n    orderId INT,\n    productId INT,\n    quantity INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY\
  \ (orderId) REFERENCES ORDERS(orderId),\n    FOREIGN KEY (productId) REFERENCES\
  \ PRODUCTS(productId)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (\n    customerId INT PRIMARY\
  \ KEY,\n    firstName VARCHAR(50),\n    lastName VARCHAR(50),\n    email VARCHAR(100),\n\
  \    phone VARCHAR(15)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE PRODUCTS (\n    productId INT PRIMARY\
  \ KEY,\n    productName VARCHAR(100),\n    productDescription VARCHAR(255),\n  \
  \  price DECIMAL(10, 2)\n);\n\nIn this case, the ORDERS table has a foreign key\
  \ referencing the CUSTOMERS table, and the LINE_ITEMS table has two foreign keys\
  \ referencing both the ORDERS and PRODUCTS tables. How would you handle this in\
  \ the YAML representation of the DFM schema?\n\nWould you create separate dependencies\
  \ for each foreign key, or would you combine them into a single dependency?\n\n\
  If you combine them, how would you represent the relationship between the foreign\
  \ keys and the referenced table?\n\nIf you create separate dependencies for each\
  \ foreign key, how would you ensure that the dependencies are correctly ordered,\
  \ as the order of the dependencies may affect the navigation paths in the cube?\n\
  \nPlease provide a YAML representation of the DFM schema for this example, demonstrating\
  \ both approaches.\n\nApproach 1: Separate dependencies for each foreign key\n\n\

  \nIn this example, the combined dependencies approach groups the foreign keys referencing\
  \ the ORDERS and PRODUCTS tables into a single dependency for each table. The order\
  \ of the dependencies is maintained by listing the foreign keys in the order they\
  \ appear in the source schema. The separate dependencies approach creates a separate\
  \ dependency for each foreign key, ensuring that the dependencies are correctly\
  \ ordered. Approach 1: Separate dependencies for each foreign key\n\nfact:\n  name:\

  \    to: PRODUCTS.productId\n  - from: LINE_ITEMS\n    to: LINE_ITEMS.quantity\n\
  \nIn the combined dependencies approach, the dependencies for the ORDERS table and\
  \ the dependencies for the LINE_ITEMS table that reference the ORDERS table are\
  \ grouped together, while the dependencies for the LINE_ITEMS table that reference\
  \ the PRODUCTS table are grouped separately. This approach simplifies the DFM schema\
  \ by reducing the number of dependencies, but it may make it more difficult to navigate\
  \ the cube when querying the data.\n\nIn the separate dependencies approach, each\
  \ foreign key has its own dependency, which allows for more flexibility in navigating\
  \ the cube. However, this approach results in more dependencies in the DFM schema,\
  \ which may make it more complex.\n\nBoth approaches are valid, and the choice between\
  \ them depends on the specific requirements of the data warehouse and the intended\
  \ use of the cube. It is important to consider factors such as query performance,\
  \ data complexity, and ease of navigation when deciding which approach to use. Thank\
  \ you for the detailed explanation. It's clear that both approaches have their advantages\
  \ and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements\
  \ of the data warehouse and the intended use of the cube.\n\nIn the combined dependencies\
  \ approach, the dependencies for the ORDERS table and the dependencies for the LINE\\\
  _ITEMS table that reference the ORDERS table are grouped together, while the dependencies\
  \ for the LINE\\_ITEMS table that reference the PRODUCTS table are grouped separately.\
  \ This approach simplifies the DFM schema by reducing the number of dependencies,\
  \ but it may make it more difficult to navigate the cube when querying the data.\n\
  \nIn the separate dependencies approach, each foreign key has its own dependency,\
  \ which allows for more flexibility in navigating the cube. However, this approach\
  \ results in more dependencies in the DFM schema, which may make it more complex.\n\
  \nIt's also worth noting that the order of the dependencies may affect the navigation\
  \ paths in the cube, as a dependency cannot be navigated until all its prerequisites\
  \ have been satisfied. In the combined dependencies approach, the order of the dependencies\
  \ is determined by the order in which the tables are listed, while in the separate\
  \ dependencies approach, the order of the dependencies is determined by the order\
  \ in which the foreign keys are listed.\n\nIn summary, both approaches have their\
  \ merits, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the\
  \ data warehouse and the intended use of the cube. It is important to consider factors\
  \ such as query performance, data complexity, and ease of navigation when deciding\
  \ which approach to use.\n\nThank you for your help! I appreciate it. You're welcome!\
  \ I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or need further assistance,\
  \ feel free to ask. Good luck with your data warehouse design! Thank you! I will\
  \ definitely reach out if I have any more questions. Have a great day! You too!\
  \ Take care and have a fantastic day! Thank you! You as well. Take care and have\
  \ a great day! Thank you for your help! I have one more question. How would you\
  \ handle the case where a table has multiple foreign keys referencing the same table,\
  \ but with different column names?\n\nFor example, let's consider the following\
  \ source schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE ORDERS (\norderId INT PRIMARY KEY,\ncustomerId\
  \ INT,\norderDate DATE,\nFOREIGN KEY (customerId) REFERENCES CUSTOMERS(customerId)\n\
  );\n\nCREATE TABLE LINE\\_ITEMS (\nlineItemId INT PRIMARY KEY,\norderId INT,\nproductId\
  \ INT,\nquantity INT,\nFOREIGN KEY (orderId) REFERENCES ORDERS(orderId),\nFOREIGN\
  \ KEY (productId) REFERENCES PRODUCTS(productId)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (\n\
  customerId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nfirstName VARCHAR(50),\nlastName VARCHAR(50),\nemail\
  \ VARCHAR(100),\nphone VARCHAR(15)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE PRODUCTS (\nproductId INT\
  \ PRIMARY KEY,\nproductName VARCHAR(100),\nproductDescription VARCHAR(255),\nprice\
  \ DECIMAL(10, 2),\ncategoryId INT,\nFOREIGN KEY (categoryId) REFERENCES CATEGORIES(categoryId)\n\
  );\n\nCREATE TABLE CATEGORIES (\ncategoryId INT PRIMARY KEY,\ncategoryName VARCHAR(100)\n\
  );\n\nIn this case, the ORDERS table has a foreign key referencing the CUSTOMERS\
  \ table, and the LINE\\_ITEMS table has two foreign keys referencing both the ORDERS\
  \ and PRODUCTS tables. However, the foreign key in the LINE\\_ITEMS table referencing\
  \ the PRODUCTS table has a different column name (productId) than the foreign key\
  \ in the ORDERS table (customerId). How would you handle this in the YAML representation\
  \ of the DFM schema?\n\nWould you create separate dependencies for each foreign\
  \ key, or would you combine them into a single dependency?\n\nIf you combine them,\
