  \ Thank you for the response. I have a follow-up question. In the YAML representation\
  \ of the DFM schema, how would you handle the case where a fact table has multiple\
  \ measures?\n\nFor example, let's consider the following source schema:\n\nCREATE\
  \ TABLE SALES (\nsaleId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nsaleDate DATE,\ncustomerId INT,\nproductId\
  \ INT,\nquantity INT,\nprice DECIMAL(10,2),\ndiscount DECIMAL(10,2)\n);\n\nIn this\
  \ case, the fact table SALES has two measures: quantity and price. How would you\
  \ represent this in the YAML DFM schema?\n\nHere is the YAML representation of the\
  \ DFM schema for the given source schema:\n\nfact:\n name: SALES\nmeasures:\n -\
  \ name: SALES.quantity\n - name: SALES.price\ndependencies:\n - from: SALES.saleId\n\
  \ to: SALES.saleDate\n - from: SALES.saleId\n to: SALES.customerId\n - from: SALES.saleId\n\
  \ to: SALES.productId\n\nIn this YAML representation, there is only one measure\
  \ listed under the \"measures\" tag. How would you modify this to include multiple\
  \ measures?\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nTo represent multiple measures in the YAML DFM\
  \ schema, you can simply list all the measures under the \"measures\" tag as separate\
  \ items, each with its own \"name\" tag. Here's an example for the given source\
  \ schema:\n\nfact:\n name: SALES\nmeasures:\n - name: SALES.quantity\n - name: SALES.price\n\
  dependencies:\n - from: SALES.saleId\n to: SALES.saleDate\n - from: SALES.saleId\n\
  \ to: SALES.customerId\n - from: SALES.saleId\n to: SALES.productId\n\nIn this example,\
  \ both \"SALES.quantity\" and \"SALES.price\" are listed as separate measures under\
  \ the \"measures\" tag. Each measure has its own \"name\" tag. The rest of the schema\
  \ remains the same. I see, thank you for the clarification. I have another question.\
  \ In the YAML representation of the DFM schema, how would you handle the case where\
  \ a dimension table has multiple hierarchies?\n\nFor example, let's consider the\
  \ following source schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS (\ncustomerId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n\
  firstName VARCHAR(50),\nlastName VARCHAR(50),\ncity VARCHAR(50),\nstate VARCHAR(50),\n\
  country VARCHAR(50)\n);\n\nIn this case, the dimension table CUSTOMERS has two hierarchies:\
  \ city and country. How would you represent this in the YAML DFM schema?\n\nHere\
  \ is the YAML representation of the DFM schema for the given source schema:\n\n\
  dimension:\n name: CUSTOMERS\nhierarchies:\n - name: City\n attributes:\n - name:\
  \ CUSTOMERS.city\n - name: CUSTOMERS.state\n - name: CUSTOMERS.country\n\nIn this\
  \ YAML representation, there is only one hierarchy listed under the \"hierarchies\"\
  \ tag. How would you modify this to include multiple hierarchies?\n\nThank you.\n\
  \n---\n\nTo represent multiple hierarchies in the YAML DFM schema, you can simply\
  \ list all the hierarchies under the \"hierarchies\" tag as separate items, each\
  \ with its own \"name\" tag and \"attributes\" tag. Here's an example for the given\
  \ source schema:\n\ndimension:\n name: CUSTOMERS\nhierarchies:\n - name: City\n\
  \ attributes:\n - name: CUSTOMERS.city\n - name: CUSTOMERS.state\n - name: CUSTOMERS.country\n\
  \n - name: Country\n attributes:\n - name: CUSTOMERS.country\n\nIn this example,\
  \ both \"City\" and \"Country\" are listed as separate hierarchies under the \"\
  hierarchies\" tag. Each hierarchy has its own \"name\" tag and \"attributes\" tag.\
  \ The \"attributes\" tag lists the attributes that belong to the hierarchy. Each\
  \ attribute has its own \"name\" tag. The rest of the schema remains the same. I\
  \ see, thank you for the explanation. I have one more question. In the YAML representation\
  \ of the DFM schema, how would you handle the case where a fact table has multiple\
  \ foreign keys referencing the same dimension table?\n\nFor example, let's consider\
  \ the following source schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE ORDERS (\norderId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n\
  orderDate DATE,\ncustomerId INT,\nproductId INT,\nshippingAddressId INT,\nbillingAddressId\
  \ INT\n);\n\nIn this case, the fact table ORDERS has two foreign keys referencing\
  \ the dimension table ADDRESSES (shippingAddressId and billingAddressId). How would\
  \ you represent this in the YAML DFM schema?\n\nHere is the YAML representation\
  \ of the DFM schema for the given source schema:\n\nfact:\n name: ORDERS\ndimensions:\n\
  \ - name: ADDRESSES\nforeignKeys:\n - name: shippingAddressId\n - name: billingAddressId\n\
  measures:\n - name: ORDERS.orderDate\n - name: ORDERS.customerId\n - name: ORDERS.productId\n\
  \nIn this YAML representation, there is only one foreign key listed under the \"\
  foreignKeys\" tag. How would you modify this to include multiple foreign keys referencing\
  \ the same dimension table?\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nTo represent multiple foreign\
  \ keys referencing the same dimension table in the YAML DFM schema, you can simply\
  \ list all the foreign keys under the \"foreignKeys\" tag as separate items, each\
  \ with its own \"name\" tag. Here's an example for the given source schema:\n\n\
  fact:\n name: ORDERS\ndimensions:\n - name: ADDRESSES\nforeignKeys:\n - name: shippingAddressId\n\
  \ - name: billingAddressId\nmeasures:\n - name: ORDERS.orderDate\n - name: ORDERS.customerId\n\
  \ - name: ORDERS.productId\n\nIn this example, both \"shippingAddressId\" and \"\
  billingAddressId\" are listed as separate foreign keys under the \"foreignKeys\"\
  \ tag. Each foreign key has its own \"name\" tag. The rest of the schema remains\
  \ the same. I see, thank you for the explanation. I have one more question. In the\
  \ YAML representation of the DFM schema, how would you handle the case where a dimension\
  \ table has multiple foreign keys referencing other dimension tables?\n\nFor example,\
  \ let's consider the following source schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE PRODUCTS (\nproductId\
  \ INT PRIMARY KEY,\nproductName VARCHAR(100),\ncategoryId INT,\nsubcategoryId INT,\n\
  manufacturerId INT\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE CATEGORIES (\ncategoryId INT PRIMARY KEY,\n\
  categoryName VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE SUB_CATEGORIES (\nsubcategoryId INT\
  \ PRIMARY KEY,\nsubcategoryName VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE MANUFACTURERS (\n\
  manufacturerId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nmanufacturerName VARCHAR(100)\n);\n\nIn this case,\
  \ the dimension table PRODUCTS has three foreign keys referencing other dimension\
  \ tables (CATEGORIES, SUB\\_CATEGORIES, and MANUFACTURERS). How would you represent\
  \ this in the YAML DFM schema?\n\nHere is the YAML representation of the DFM schema\
  \ for the given source schema:\n\ndimension:\n name: PRODUCTS\nforeignKeys:\n -\
  \ name: categoryId\n - name: subcategoryId\n - name: manufacturerId\nattributes:\n\
  \ - name: PRODUCTS.productId\n - name: PRODUCTS.productName\n\nIn this YAML representation,\
  \ there is only one foreign key listed under the \"foreignKeys\" tag. How would\
  \ you modify this to include multiple foreign keys referencing other dimension tables?\n\

  \ the explanation. I have one more question. In the YAML representation of the DFM\
  \ schema, how would you handle the case where a fact table has a composite primary\
  \ key?\n\nFor example, let's consider the following source schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE\
  \ SALES (\nsaleId INT,\nsaleDate DATE,\ncustomerId INT,\nproductId INT,\nquantity\
  \ INT,\nprice DECIMAL(10,2),\ndiscount DECIMAL(10,2),\nPRIMARY KEY (saleId, saleDate)\n\
  );\n\nIn this case, the fact table SALES has a composite primary key (saleId and\
