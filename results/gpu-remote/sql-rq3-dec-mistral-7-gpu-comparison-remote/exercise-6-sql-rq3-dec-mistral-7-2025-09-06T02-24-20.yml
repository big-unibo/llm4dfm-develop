  \ TRANSFERS.reason\n    to: TRANSFERS.reason Thank you for the YAML representation\

  \ I have another question regarding the DFM schema. In the YAML representation,\
  \ how would you handle the case where there are multiple dimensions for a single\
  \ fact table? For example, in the recruitment schema, we might want to include both\
  \ the department and the division as dimensions. How would you modify the YAML to\

  \ TRANSFERS\nmeasures:\n  - name: recruitmentDate\n  - name: salary\ndimensions:\n\
  \  - name: department\n    attributes:\n      - name: departmentName\n      - name:\
  \ departmentCode\n  - name: division\n    attributes:\n      - name: divisionName\n\
  \      - name: divCode\n\nIn this example, I added a new dimension called \"division\"\
  \ and its corresponding attributes. The \"department\" dimension is still present.\n\
  \nPlease confirm if this is the correct way to handle multiple dimensions for a\
  \ single fact table in the YAML representation of the DFM schema.\n\nYes, you are\
  \ correct. In the YAML representation of the DFM schema, you can handle multiple\
  \ dimensions for a single fact table by simply adding additional dimension items\
  \ under the \"dimensions\" tag. Each dimension item should contain a \"name\" tag\
  \ that specifies the name of the dimension, and an \"attributes\" tag that contains\
  \ a list of attribute items. Each attribute item should contain a \"name\" tag that\
  \ specifies the name of the attribute.\n\nIn your example, you added a new dimension\
  \ called \"division\" and its corresponding attributes. The \"department\" dimension\
  \ is still present. This is the correct way to handle multiple dimensions for a\
  \ single fact table in the YAML representation of the DFM schema.\n\nHere's the\
  \ updated YAML for the recruitment schema with multiple dimensions:\n\nfact:\n \
  \ name: TRANSFERS\nmeasures:\n  - name: recruitmentDate\n  - name: salary\ndimensions:\n\
  \  - name: department\n    attributes:\n      - name: departmentName\n      - name:\
  \ departmentCode\n  - name: division\n    attributes:\n      - name: divisionName\n\
  \      - name: divCode\n\nIn this example, the \"department\" and \"division\" dimensions\
  \ are both present, with their corresponding attributes. The \"recruitmentDate\"\
  \ and \"salary\" measures are still present. Thank you for your help. I have one\
  \ more question regarding the DFM schema. In the YAML representation, how would\
  \ you handle the case where there are multiple hierarchies for a single dimension?\
  \ For example, in the recruitment schema, we might want to include both the department\
  \ hierarchy and the division hierarchy under the department dimension. How would\
  \ you modify the YAML to accommodate this?\n\nHere's an example of the modified\
  \ YAML:\n\nfact:\n  name: TRANSFERS\nmeasures:\n  - name: recruitmentDate\n  - name:\
  \ salary\ndimensions:\n  - name: department\n    hierarchies:\n      - name: departmentHierarchy\n\

  \              - name: subDivisionCode\n\nIn this example, I added a new hierarchy\
  \ called \"divisionHierarchy\" under the \"department\" dimension. The \"departmentHierarchy\"\
  \ is still present.\n\nPlease confirm if this is the correct way to handle multiple\
  \ hierarchies for a single dimension in the YAML representation of the DFM schema.\n\
  \nYes, you are correct. In the YAML representation of the DFM schema, you can handle\
  \ multiple hierarchies for a single dimension by simply adding additional hierarchy\
  \ items under the \"hierarchies\" tag of the corresponding dimension. Each hierarchy\
  \ item should contain a \"name\" tag that specifies the name of the hierarchy, and\
  \ a \"levels\" tag that contains a list of level items. Each level item should contain\
  \ a \"name\" tag that specifies the name of the level, and an \"attributes\" tag\
  \ that contains a list of attribute items. Each attribute item should contain a\
  \ \"name\" tag that specifies the name of the attribute.\n\nIn your example, you\
  \ added a new hierarchy called \"divisionHierarchy\" under the \"department\" dimension,\
  \ with its corresponding levels and attributes. The \"departmentHierarchy\" is still\
  \ present. This is the correct way to handle multiple hierarchies for a single dimension\
  \ in the YAML representation of the DFM schema.\n\nHere's the updated YAML for the\
  \ recruitment schema with multiple hierarchies:\n\nfact:\n  name: TRANSFERS\nmeasures:\n\
  \  - name: recruitmentDate\n  - name: salary\ndimensions:\n  - name: department\n\
  \    hierarchies:\n      - name: departmentHierarchy\n        levels:\n        \
  \  - name: departmentLevel1\n            attributes:\n              - name: departmentName\n\
  \              - name: departmentCode\n          - name: departmentLevel2\n    \
  \        attributes:\n              - name: subDepartmentName\n              - name:\
  \ subDepartmentCode\n      - name: divisionHierarchy\n        levels:\n        \
  \  - name: divisionLevel1\n            attributes:\n              - name: divisionName\n\
  \              - name: divCode\n          - name: divisionLevel2\n            attributes:\n\
  \              - name: subDivisionName\n              - name: subDivisionCode\n\n\
  In this example, the \"department\" dimension now has two hierarchies: \"departmentHierarchy\"\
  \ and \"divisionHierarchy\", with their corresponding levels and attributes. The\
  \ \"recruitmentDate\" and \"salary\" measures are still present. Thank you for your\
  \ help. I have one more question regarding the DFM schema. In the YAML representation,\
  \ how would you handle the case where there are multiple facts for a single dimension?\
  \ For example, in the recruitment schema, we might want to include both the number\
  \ of transfers and the number of employees as facts under the department dimension.\
  \ How would you modify the YAML to accommodate this?\n\nHere's an example of the\
  \ modified YAML:\n\nfact:\n  name: TRANSFERS\nfacts:\n  - name: numberOfTransfers\n\
  \    measures:\n      - name: count\n  - name: numberOfEmployees\n    measures:\n\
  \      - name: count\ndimensions:\n  - name: department\n    hierarchies:\n    \

  \              - name: subDepartmentName\n              - name: subDepartmentCode\n\
  \nIn this example, I added a new fact called \"numberOfEmployees\" under the \"\
  department\" dimension. The \"numberOfTransfers\" fact is still present.\n\nPlease\
  \ confirm if this is the correct way to handle multiple facts for a single dimension\
  \ in the YAML representation of the DFM schema.\n\nYes, you are correct. In the\
  \ YAML representation of the DFM schema, you can handle multiple facts for a single\
  \ dimension by simply adding additional fact items under the \"facts\" tag of the\
  \ corresponding dimension. Each fact item should contain a \"name\" tag that specifies\
  \ the name of the fact, and a \"measures\" tag that contains a list of measure items.\
  \ Each measure item should contain a \"name\" tag that specifies the name of the\
  \ measure.\n\nIn your example, you added a new fact called \"numberOfEmployees\"\
  \ under the \"department\" dimension, with its corresponding measure. The \"numberOfTransfers\"\
  \ fact is still present. This is the correct way to handle multiple facts for a\
  \ single dimension in the YAML representation of the DFM schema.\n\nHere's the updated\
  \ YAML for the recruitment schema with multiple facts:\n\nfact:\n  name: TRANSFERS\n\
  facts:\n  - name: numberOfTransfers\n    measures:\n      - name: count\n  - name:\
  \ numberOfEmployees\n    measures:\n      - name: count\ndimensions:\n  - name:\
  \ department\n    hierarchies:\n      - name: departmentHierarchy\n        levels:\n\
  \          - name: departmentLevel1\n            attributes:\n              - name:\
  \ departmentName\n              - name: departmentCode\n          - name: departmentLevel2\n\
  \            attributes:\n              - name: subDepartmentName\n            \
  \  - name: subDepartmentCode\n\nIn this example, the \"department\" dimension now\
  \ has two facts: \"numberOfTransfers\" and \"numberOfEmployees\", with their corresponding\
  \ measures. The \"recruitmentDate\" and \"salary\" measures are not present in this\
  \ fact table, as they are measures for the \"TRANSFERS\" fact only. Thank you for\

  \ For example, in the recruitment schema, we might want to include both the number\
