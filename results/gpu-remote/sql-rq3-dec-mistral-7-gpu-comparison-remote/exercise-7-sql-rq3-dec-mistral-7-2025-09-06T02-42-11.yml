  \ to each other through foreign key relationships in the source schema, and these\
  \ relationships are reflected in the dependencies specified in the YAML representation.\
  \ For example, the PickupPlace and DropoffPlace dimensions are related to the RENTAL_OFFICES\
  \ dimension through the OfficeName foreign key, and this relationship is represented\
  \ in the YAML as a dependency from RENTAL_OFFICES.OfficeName to RENTALS.PickupPlace\
  \ and RENTALS.DropoffPlace. Similarly, the Plate dimension is related to the CARS,\
  \ HAVE_OPTIONAL, DRIVERS, DRIVE, INSURANCES, and PAYMENTS dimensions through foreign\
  \ key relationships, and these relationships are represented in the YAML as dependencies\
  \ from these dimensions to the Plate dimension. The YAML representation also includes\
  \ dependencies from the RENTALS fact table to each of the measures, indicating that\
  \ each measure is a measure of the RENTALS fact table. I apologize for any confusion\
