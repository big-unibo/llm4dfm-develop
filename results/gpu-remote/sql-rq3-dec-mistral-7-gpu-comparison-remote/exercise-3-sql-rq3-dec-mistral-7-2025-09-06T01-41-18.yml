  \  - from: PURCHASES\n    to: STORES.StoreCode Thank you for the response. I have\
  \ one more question. How would the YAML representation look like if we have multiple\
  \ facts in the data warehouse?\n\nFor example, let's say we have two facts: Sales\
  \ and Inventory. The Sales fact would have measures like Total Sales, Average Sales,\
  \ etc., and the Inventory fact would have measures like Total Inventory, Average\
  \ Inventory, etc.\n\nBoth facts would have dimensions like Time, Product, Store,\
  \ etc. However, some dimensions would be common between the two facts (e.g., Time\
  \ and Product), while others would be unique to each fact (e.g., Sales would have\
  \ a dimension called Salesperson, while Inventory would have a dimension called\
  \ Warehouse).\n\nHere is an example of the source schema for the Sales fact:\n\n\
  CREATE TABLE SALES (\nSaleId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nSaleDate DATE,\nStoreId INT,\nProductId\
  \ INT,\nSalespersonId INT,\nTotalSales FLOAT,\nAverageSales FLOAT,\n...\n);\n\n\
  And here is an example of the source schema for the Inventory fact:\n\nCREATE TABLE\
  \ INVENTORY (\nInvId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nInvDate DATE,\nStoreId INT,\nProductId INT,\n\
  WarehouseId INT,\nTotalInventory FLOAT,\nAverageInventory FLOAT,\n...\n);\n\nPlease\
  \ provide the YAML representation for the DFM schema for the Sales and Inventory\
  \ facts, including the common and unique dimensions for each fact.\n\nNote: The\
  \ YAML representation should include the facts, measures, and dimensions sections\
  \ for each fact, as well as the hierarchy relationships between the dimensions.\n\
  \nAlso, please assume that the Time dimension has a hierarchy with levels Year,\
  \ Quarter, Month, and Day. The Product dimension has a hierarchy with levels Category,\
  \ Subcategory, and Product. The Store dimension has a hierarchy with levels Region,\
  \ State, and Store. The Salesperson dimension has a hierarchy with levels Manager,\
  \ Team, and Salesperson. The Warehouse dimension has a hierarchy with levels Warehouse\
  \ Group, Warehouse, and Zone.\n\nLastly, the Sales fact would have a relationship\
  \ with the Inventory fact on the Product dimension, where the ProductId in the Sales\
  \ fact would be related to the ProductId in the Inventory fact.\n\nHere is an example\
  \ of what the YAML representation might look like for a single fact:\n\nfact:\n\
  name: Sales\nmeasures:\n- name: TotalSales\n- name: AverageSales\n...\ndimensions:\n\
  - name: Time\n  hierarchy:\n  - level: Year\n  - level: Quarter\n  - level: Month\n\
  \  - level: Day\n- name: Product\n  hierarchy:\n  - level: Category\n  - level:\
  \ Subcategory\n  - level: Product\n- name: Store\n  hierarchy:\n  - level: Region\n\
  \  - level: State\n  - level: Store\n- name: Salesperson\n  hierarchy:\n  - level:\
  \ Manager\n  - level: Team\n  - level: Salesperson\n\nPlease extend this example\
  \ to include the Inventory fact as well, with its unique dimensions and relationships\
  \ with the Sales fact.\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\nfact:\nname: Sales\nmeasures:\n-\

  \nThis YAML representation includes the facts, measures, and dimensions for each\
  \ fact, as well as the hierarchy relationships between the dimensions. It also includes\
  \ a relationship between the Sales and Inventory facts on the Product dimension,\
  \ where the ProductId in the Sales fact would be related to the ProductId in the\
  \ Inventory fact. I have extended the YAML representation to include the Inventory\
  \ fact as well, with its unique dimensions and relationships with the Sales fact.\
