  \ Thank you for the response. I have one more question. In the YAML representation,\
  \ is it necessary to include the foreign keys in the dependencies section?\n\nFor\
  \ example, in the first example you provided, is it necessary to include the foreign\
  \ keys in the dependencies section of the DFM schema?\n\nIn other words, is it necessary\
  \ to include the following lines in the DFM schema:\n\n- from: PURCHASE.storeId\n\
  \  to: STORES.storeId\n- from: PURCHASE.artId\n  to: ARTICLES.artId\n\nOr can we\
  \ omit them since they are already represented in the fact table?\n\nI am asking\
  \ this because I am trying to understand the purpose of including foreign keys in\
  \ the dependencies section of the DFM schema.\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nBest\
  \ regards.\n\n-- User\n\n---\n\nIn the YAML representation, it is not necessary\
  \ to include the foreign keys in the dependencies section if they are already represented\

  \ is to show the relationships between the fact table and the dimension tables,\
  \ but since the foreign keys are already present in the fact table, they are implicitly\
  \ included in the relationships. Including them in the dependencies section can\
  \ be useful for clarity and documentation purposes, but it is not strictly necessary.\
  \ I see, thank you for the clarification. That helps me understand the purpose of\

  \ following line:\n\n- from: ARTICLES.artId\nto: ARTICLES.artName\n\nOr can we omit\
  \ it since it is already clear from the context that artId is the foreign key referencing\
