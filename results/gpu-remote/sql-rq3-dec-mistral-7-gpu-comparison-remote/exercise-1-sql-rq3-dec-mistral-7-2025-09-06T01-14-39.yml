  \ response. I have one more question. How would the YAML representation look like\
  \ if we want to include the total cost of each installation? Let's assume that the\
  \ total cost of an installation is the sum of the cost of the computer and the cost\
  \ of the software.\n\nTo calculate the cost of a computer, we can join the COMPUTER\
  \ table with the SUPPLIES table using the Brand column. The cost of a computer is\
  \ the unit price of the computer multiplied by the quantity of the computer. To\
  \ calculate the cost of a software, we can join the SOFTWARE table with the INSTALLATIONS\
  \ table using the CodSoftw column. The cost of a software is the unit price of the\
  \ software multiplied by the quantity of the software.\n\nPlease update the YAML\
  \ representation to include the total cost of each installation.\n\nfact:\n  name:\
