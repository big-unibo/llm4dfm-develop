  \ Thank you for the response. I have one more question. How would the YAML representation\
  \ look like if we have multiple facts in the data warehouse?\n\nFor example, let's\
  \ say we have two facts: Sales and Inventory. The Sales fact has measures such as\
  \ Total Sales, Average Sales Price, and Number of Units Sold. The Inventory fact\
  \ has measures such as Total Inventory, Average Inventory Age, and Number of Items\
  \ in Stock.\n\nBoth facts share some dimensions, such as Time, Product, and Store.\
  \ However, they also have unique dimensions, such as Sales Channel for Sales and\
  \ Warehouse Location for Inventory.\n\nHere's an example of the source schema for\
  \ the Sales fact:\n\nCREATE TABLE SALES (\nSaleId INT PRIMARY KEY,\nSaleDate DATE,\n\
  StoreId INT,\nProductId INT,\nSalesChannel VARCHAR(50),\nUnitsSold INT,\nTotalSales\
  \ DECIMAL(10,2),\nAverageSalesPrice DECIMAL(10,2)\n);\n\nAnd here's an example of\
  \ the source schema for the Inventory fact:\n\nCREATE TABLE INVENTORY (\nInventoryId\
  \ INT PRIMARY KEY,\nInventoryDate DATE,\nStoreId INT,\nProductId INT,\nWarehouseLocation\
  \ VARCHAR(50),\nUnitsInStock INT,\nTotalInventory DECIMAL(10,2),\nAverageInventoryAge\
  \ DECIMAL(10,2)\n);\n\nPlease provide the YAML representation for both facts, including\
  \ their measures, dimensions, and any relationships between them.\n\nNote: For simplicity,\
  \ let's assume that the Time dimension has only one attribute, Date.\n\nAlso, let's\
  \ assume that the Product dimension has two attributes, ProductId and ProductName.\n\
  \nLastly, let's assume that the Store dimension has three attributes, StoreId, StoreName,\
  \ and StoreAddress.\n\nThe YAML representation for the Sales fact should be as follows:\n\
  \nfact:\n name: Sales\n measures:\n - name: TotalSales\n - name: AverageSalesPrice\n\
  \ - name: NumberOfUnitsSold\n dimensions:\n - name: Time\n attributes:\n - name:\
