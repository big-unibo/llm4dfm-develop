  \ BOARDING_CARD.boardingCardCode\n    to: CHECK_IN.numberOfBags Thank you for the\
  \ response. I have one more question. How would the YAML representation look like\
  \ if we wanted to include the hierarchy of the dimensions as well? For example,\
  \ in the airport schema, we have the hierarchy: Airport -> City -> Nation.\n\nIn\
  \ this case, the YAML representation would look like:\n\nfact:\nname: TICKET\nmeasures:\n\
  - name: PURCHASE.totalAmount\n- name: TICKET.flightAmount\n- name: TICKET.taxAmount\n\
  \ndimensions:\n- name: Airport\ndimensions:\n- name: City\ndimensions:\n- name:\
  \ Nation\n\ndependencies:\n- from: PERSON.personCode\nto: PERSON.name\n...\n\nHere,\
  \ the \"dimensions\" tag under the \"fact\" tag contains a list of dimensions, each\
  \ of which has its own \"name\" tag and a nested \"dimensions\" tag that contains\
  \ the hierarchy of the dimension.\n\nPlease apply this structure to the given airport\
  \ schema and return the YAML representation.\n\nThe following logical schema describes\
  \ an operational database for airport transactions.\n\nCREATE TABLE PERSON (\npersonCode\

  \ I provided, the \"dimensions\" tag under the \"fact\" tag contains a list of dimensions,\
  \ each of which has its own \"name\" tag and a nested \"dimensions\" tag that contains\
  \ the hierarchy of the dimension. However, in the airport schema, the hierarchy\
  \ is not explicitly defined in the schema. Instead, the hierarchy is inferred from\
  \ the relationships between the tables.\n\nIn this case, the hierarchy would be\
  \ inferred as follows:\n\n- Airport is the top-level dimension, with no parent dimension.\n\
  - City is a child dimension of Airport, with Airport as its parent dimension.\n\
  - Nation is a child dimension of City, with City as its parent dimension.\n\nTo\
  \ represent this hierarchy in the YAML, we can use the \"parent\" tag to indicate\
  \ the parent dimension of each child dimension. Here is the updated YAML representation:\n\
