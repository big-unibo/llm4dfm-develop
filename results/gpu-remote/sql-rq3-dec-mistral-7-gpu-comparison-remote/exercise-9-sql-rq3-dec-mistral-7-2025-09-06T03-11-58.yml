  Here's another example for you to practice:\n\nCREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (\n    employee\\\
  _id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    first\\_name VARCHAR(50),\n    last\\_name VARCHAR(50),\n\
  \    hire\\_date DATE,\n    department\\_id INT,\n    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),\n \
  \   FOREIGN KEY (department\\_id) REFERENCES DEPARTMENTS(department\\_id)\n);\n\n\
  CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENTS (\n    department\\_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n    department\\\
  _name VARCHAR(50),\n    manager\\_id INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY (manager\\_id) REFERENCES\
  \ EMPLOYEES(employee\\_id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE PROJECTS (\n    project\\_id INT\
  \ PRIMARY KEY,\n    project\\_name VARCHAR(100),\n    start\\_date DATE,\n    end\\\
  _date DATE,\n    budget DECIMAL(10, 2),\n    manager\\_id INT,\n    FOREIGN KEY\
  \ (manager\\_id) REFERENCES EMPLOYEES(employee\\_id)\n);\n\nCREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE\\\
  _PROJECTS (\n    employee\\_id INT,\n    project\\_id INT,\n    role VARCHAR(50),\n\
  \    start\\_date DATE,\n    end\\_date DATE,\n    FOREIGN KEY (employee\\_id) REFERENCES\
  \ EMPLOYEES(employee\\_id),\n    FOREIGN KEY (project\\_id) REFERENCES PROJECTS(project\\\
  _id)\n);\n\nAfter step 1, the list of FDs is the following:\n\n- EMPLOYEES.employee\\\
  _id->EMPLOYEES.first\\_name\n- EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.last\\_name\n\
  - EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.hire\\_date\n- EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.department\\\
  _id\n- EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.salary\n- DEPARTMENTS.department\\_id->DEPARTMENTS.department\\\
  _name\n- DEPARTMENTS.department\\_id->DEPARTMENTS.manager\\_id\n- PROJECTS.project\\\
  _id->PROJECTS.project\\_name\n- PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.start\\_date\n-\
  \ PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.end\\_date\n- PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.budget\n\
  - PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.manager\\_id\n- EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.employee\\\
  _id->EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.role\n- EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.employee\\\
  _id\n- EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.project\\_id->EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.start\\_date\n- EMPLOYEE\\\
  _PROJECTS.project\\_id->EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.end\\_date\n- EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.project\\\
  _id->PROJECTS.project\\_id\n\nAfter step 2, the list of FDs is changed as follows:\n\
  \n- EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.first\\_name, EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.last\\\
  _name, EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.hire\\_date, EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.department\\\
  _id, EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.salary are replaced with EMPLOYEES.employee\\\
  _id->EMPLOYEES.*\n- DEPARTMENTS.department\\_id->DEPARTMENTS.department\\_name,\
  \ DEPARTMENTS.department\\_id->DEPARTMENTS.manager\\_id are replaced with DEPARTMENTS.department\\\
  _id->DEPARTMENTS.*\n- PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.project\\_name, PROJECTS.project\\\
  _id->PROJECTS.start\\_date, PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.end\\_date, PROJECTS.project\\\
  _id->PROJECTS.budget, PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.manager\\_id are replaced\
  \ with PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.*\n- EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEE\\\
  _PROJECTS.role, EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id, EMPLOYEE\\\
  _PROJECTS.project\\_id->EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.start\\_date, EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.project\\\
  _id->EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.end\\_date, EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.project\\_id->PROJECTS.project\\\
  _id are replaced with EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.employee\\_id->EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.*\n\
  \nAfter step 3, the YAML expression of the DFM schema is obtained as follows:\n\n\
  fact:\n  name: EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS\nmeasures:\n  - name: EMPLOYEES.salary\ndependencies:\n\
  \  - from: EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id\n    to: EMPLOYEES.*\n  - from: DEPARTMENTS.department\\\

  \  - from: EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.employee\\_id\n    to: EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.*\n  -\
  \ from: EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.project\\_id\n    to: EMPLOYEES.employee\\_id\n  - from:\
  \ EMPLOYEE\\_PROJECTS.project\\_id\n    to: PROJECTS.project\\_id\n\nHere is another\
