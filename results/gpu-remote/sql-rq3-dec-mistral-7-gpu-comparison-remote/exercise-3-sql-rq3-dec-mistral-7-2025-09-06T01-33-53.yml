  \ STORES.StoreCode Thank you for the response. I have one more question. How would\
  \ you handle a scenario where a table has a composite primary key with multiple\
  \ columns?\n\nFor example, let's say we have a table called `EMPLOYEES` with the\
  \ following schema:\n\nCREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (\n    employeeId INT,\n    departmentId\
  \ INT,\n    firstName VARCHAR(100),\n    lastName VARCHAR(100),\n    salary FLOAT,\n\
  \    PRIMARY KEY (employeeId, departmentId)\n);\n\nIn this case, the primary key\
  \ is a combination of `employeeId` and `departmentId`. How would this affect the\
  \ FDs and the resulting DFM schema?\n\nPlease provide the YAML representation of\
  \ the resulting DFM schema for this example.\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\nfact:\n  name:\
  \ EMPLOYEES\nmeasures:\n  - name: EMPLOYEES.salary\ndependencies:\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId,\
  \ EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.employeeId\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId,\
  \ EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId,\
  \ EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.firstName\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId,\
  \ EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.lastName\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId,\
  \ EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.salary\n\nIn this case, the primary\
  \ key is a combination of `employeeId` and `departmentId`. The FDs are generated\
  \ by considering the composite primary key as a single entity. The resulting DFM\
  \ schema includes dependencies from the composite primary key to all other attributes\
  \ in the `EMPLOYEES` table. The measures are the same as in the previous examples.\
  \ You are correct. In the case of a composite primary key, the FDs are generated\
  \ by considering the composite primary key as a single entity. The resulting DFM\
  \ schema includes dependencies from the composite primary key to all other attributes\
  \ in the table.\n\nHere is the YAML representation of the resulting DFM schema for\
  \ the `EMPLOYEES` table:\n\nfact:\n  name: EMPLOYEES\nmeasures:\n  - name: EMPLOYEES.salary\n\
  dependencies:\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId, EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.employeeId\n\
  \  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId, EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n\
  \  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId, EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.firstName\n\
  \  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId, EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.lastName\n\
  \  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId, EMPLOYEES.departmentId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.salary\
  \ I apologize for any confusion. In the case of a composite primary key, the FDs\
  \ are generated by considering each column of the composite key separately. The\
  \ resulting DFM schema includes dependencies from each column of the composite primary\
  \ key to all other attributes in the table that are functionally dependent on that\
  \ column.\n\nHere is the corrected YAML representation of the resulting DFM schema\
  \ for the `EMPLOYEES` table:\n\nfact:\n  name: EMPLOYEES\nmeasures:\n  - name: EMPLOYEES.salary\n\
  dependencies:\n  - from: EMPLOYEES.employeeId\n    to: EMPLOYEES.employeeId\n  -\
