  \ concept in detail about a specific mathematical concept or principle, focusing\
  \ on the importance of the following input.\n\n\n\nThe task is to explain the following\
  \ input\n\n\n1. **Question:**\n\nGiven the concept of a mathematical function that\
  \ is continuous and differentiable.\n\n\nThe concept you're asking about is the\
  \ continuity of a mathematical function that is continuous and differentiable. In\
  \ mathematics, a function \\( f \\) is said to be continuous at a point \\( c \\\
  ) if for every \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), there exists a \\(\\delta > 0\\) such that for\
  \ all \\(x\\) in the domain of \\( f \\), if \\( |x - c| < \\delta \\), then \\\
  ( |f(x) - f(c)| < \\epsilon \\). This means that small changes in the input \\(\
  \ x \\) result in small changes in the output \\( f(x) \\), and the function does\
  \ not have any sudden jumps or breaks.\n\nA function \\( f \\) is differentiable\
  \ at a point \\( c \\) if the limit \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(c + h) - f(c)}{h}\\\
  ) exists. This limit, if it exists, is called the derivative of \\( f \\) at \\\
  ( c \\) and is denoted by \\( f'(c) \\).\n\nTo explain this concept further:\n\n\
  1. **Continuity**:\n   - Continuity at a point \\( c \\) means that the function\
  \ \\( f \\) does not have any abrupt changes or jumps at \\( c \\). In other words,\
  \ as \\( x \\) gets closer and closer to \\( c \\), the value of \\( f(x) \\) gets\
  \ closer and closer to \\( f(c) \\).\n\n2. **Differentiability**:\n   - Differentiability\
  \ at a point \\( c \\) is a stronger condition than continuity. It means that not\
  \ only does \\( f \\) have to be continuous at \\( c \\), but also that the rate\
  \ at which \\( f(x) \\) changes as \\( x \\) approaches \\( c \\) is well-defined\
  \ and can be described by a single number, the derivative \\( f'(c) \\). This derivative\
  \ represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \\( f \\) at the point\
  \ \\( (c, f(c)) \\).\n\nTo summarize, continuity is about the function not having\
  \ any breaks or jumps at a point, while differentiability is about the function\
  \ having a well-defined slope at that point, which implies continuity but is a more\
  \ stringent condition.\n\nThe provided the following input\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
  \nTo solve the given problem, we need to explain the following input\n\nThe concept\
  \ you're asking about a mathematical function that is continuous and differentiable.\n\
  \nA function \\( f \\) is said to be differentiable if it is continuous and its\
  \ derivative at a point \\( c \\) if it is continuous at \\( c \\) and the derivative\
  \ \\( f'(c) exists. This means that not only must the function \\( f \\) be continuous\
  \ at \\( c \\), but it also requires that the limit \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(c\
  \ + h) - f(c)}{h}\\) exists. This limit, if it exists, is called the derivative\
  \ of \\( f \\) at \\( c \\) and is denoted by \\( f'(c) \\).\n\nTo summarize, continuity\
  \ at a point \\( c \\) ensures that the function does not have any breaks or jumps\
  \ at \\( c \\), while differentiability at \\( c \\) ensures that the function has\
  \ a well-defined slope or rate of change at \\( c
