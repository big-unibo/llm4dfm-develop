      Carry out demand-driven conceptual
      design of a multidimensional cube using the DFM (Dimensional Fact Model), starting from the following
      requirements. 
      The output I expect is a DFM schema in YAML formatted as follows: 
      (1) the fact is a "fact" tag including a "name" tag; 
      (2) all measures are listed inside a "measures" tag, each is an empty item containing a "name" tag; 
      (3) all many-to-one associations between attributes in a hierarchy are listed inside a "dependencies" 
      tag: each is an empty item containing a "from" tag, listing the finer attribute, a "to" tag, listing 
      the coarser attribute, and optionally a "role" tag; 
      (4) the "dependencies" list also includes an item from the fact to each dimension, and one from 
      the fact to each measure.

      Return only the YAML without any further information/explanation.

      Please apply this process to the following source schema, and create the YAML representation of the resulting DFM schema.
      You must only output the YAML file. You MUST NOT generate any comment before or after. Output only one YAML valid response and immediately stop generating.
